<h2><a name="page1"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 1</span>I</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> day had been very hot under the
tall trees which everywhere embower and stifle Saratoga, for they
shut out the air as well as the sun; and after tea (they still
have an early dinner at all the hotels in Saratoga, and tea is
the last meal of the day) I strolled over to the pretty Congress
Park, in the hope of getting a breath of coolness there.&nbsp;
Mrs. March preferred to take the chances on the verandah of our
pleasant little hotel, where I left her with the other ladies,
forty fanning like one, as they rocked to and fro under the roof
lifted to the third story by those lofty shafts peculiar to the
Saratoga architecture.&nbsp; As far as coolness was concerned, I
thought she was wise after I reached the park, for I found none
of it there.&nbsp; I tried first a chair in the arabesque
pavilion (I call it arabesque in despair; it might very well be
Swiss; it is charming, at all events), and studied to deceive
myself with the fresh-looking ebullition of the spring in the
vast glass bowls your goblets are served from (people say it is
pumped, and artificially a&euml;rated); but after a few moments
this would not do, and I went out to a bench, of the rows beside
the gravelled walks.&nbsp; It was no better there; but I fancied
it would be better on the little isle in the little lake, where
the fountain was flinging a sheaf of spray into the dull
air.&nbsp; This looked even cooler than the bubbling spring in
the glass vases, and it sounded vastly cooler.&nbsp; There would
be mosquitoes there, of course, I admitted in the debate I had
with myself before I decided to make experiment of the place, and
the event proved me right.&nbsp; There were certainly some
mosquitoes in the Grecian temple (if it is not a Turkish kiosk;
perhaps we had better compromise, and call it a Grecian kiosk),
which you reach by a foot-bridge from the mainland, and there was
a damp in the air which might pass for coolness.&nbsp; There were
three or four people standing vaguely about in the kiosk; but my
idle mind fixed itself upon a young French-Canadian mother of low
degree, who sat, with her small boy, on the verge of the pavement
near the water.&nbsp; She scolded him in their parlance for
having got himself so dirty, and then she smacked his poor,
filthy little hands, with a frown of superior virtue, though I
did not find her so very much cleaner herself.&nbsp; I cannot see
children beaten without a heartache, and I continued to suffer
for this small wretch even after he had avenged himself by eating
a handful of peanut shells, which would be sure to disagree with
him and make his mother more trouble.&nbsp; In fact, I
experienced no relief till his mother, having spent her insensate
passion, gathered him up with sufficient tenderness, and carried
him away.&nbsp; Then, for the first time, I noticed a girl
sitting in a chair just outside the kiosk, and showing a graceful
young figure as she partly turned to look after the departing
mother and her child.&nbsp; When she turned again and glanced in
my direction, at the noise I made in placing my chair, I could
see two things&mdash;that she had as much beauty as grace, and
that she was disappointed in me.&nbsp; The latter fact did not
wound me, for I felt its profound impersonality.&nbsp; I was not
wrong in myself; I was simply wrong in being an elderly man with
a grey beard instead of the handsome shape and phase of youth
which her own young beauty had a right to in my place.&nbsp; I
was not only not wounded, but I was not sorry not to be that
shape and phase of youth, except as I hate to disappoint any
one.</p>
<p>Her face was very beautiful; it was quite perfectly beautiful,
and of such classic mould that she might well have been the
tutelary goddess of that temple (if it was a temple, and not a
kiosk), in the white duck costume which the goddesses were
wearing that summer.&nbsp; Her features were Greek, but her looks
were American; and she was none the less a goddess, I decided,
because of that air of something exacting, of not quite
satisfied, which made me more and more willing to be elderly and
grey-bearded.&nbsp; I at least should not be expected to supply
the worship necessary to keep such a goddess in good humour.</p>
<p>I do not know just how I can account for a strain of
compassion which mingled with this sense of irresponsibility in
me; perhaps it was my feeling of security that attuned me to
pity; but certainly I did not look at this young girl long
without beginning to grieve for her, and to weave about her a web
of possibilities, which grew closer and firmer in texture when
she was joined by a couple who had apparently not left her a
great while before, and who spoke, without otherwise saluting
her, as they sat down on either side of her.&nbsp; I instantly
interpreted her friends to be the young wife and middle-aged
husband of a second marriage; for they were evidently man and
wife, and he must have been nearly twice as old as she.&nbsp; In
person he tended to the weight which expresses settled
prosperity, and a certain solidification of temperament and
character; as to his face, it was kind, and it was rather
humorous, in spite of being a little slow in the cast of mind it
suggested.&nbsp; He wore an iron-grey beard on his cheeks and
chin, but he had his strong upper lip clean shaven; some drops of
perspiration stood upon it, and upon his forehead, which showed
itself well up toward his crown under the damp strings of his
scanty hair.&nbsp; He looked at the young goddess in white duck
with a sort of trouble in his friendly countenance, and his wife
(if it was his wife) seemed to share his concern, though she
smiled, while he let the corners of his straight mouth
droop.&nbsp; She was smaller than the young girl, and I thought
almost as young; and she had the air of being somehow responsible
for her, and cowed by her, though the word says rather more than
I mean.&nbsp; She was not so well dressed; that is, not so
stylishly, though doubtless her costume was more expensive.&nbsp;
It seemed the inspiration of a village dressmaker; and her
husband&rsquo;s low-cut waistcoat, and his expanse of plaited
shirt-front, betrayed a provincial ideal which she would never
decry&mdash;which she would perhaps never find different from the
most worldly.&nbsp; He had probably, I swiftly imagined, been
wearing just that kind of clothes for twenty years, and telling
his tailor to make each new suit like the last; he had been
buying for the same period the same shape of Panama hat,
regardless of the continually changing type of straw hats on
other heads.&nbsp; I cannot say just why, as he tilted his chair
back on its hind-legs, I felt that he was either the cashier of
the village bank at home, or one of the principal business men of
the place.&nbsp; Village people I was quite resolute to have them
all; but I left them free to have come from some small
manufacturing centre in western Massachusetts or southern Vermont
or central New York.&nbsp; It was easy to see that they were not
in the habit of coming away from their place, wherever it was;
and I wondered whether they were finding their account in the
present excursion.</p>
<p>I myself think Saratoga one of the most delightful spectacles
in the world, and Mrs. March is of the same mind about it.&nbsp;
We like all the waters, and drink them without regard to their
different properties; but we rather prefer the Congress spring,
because it is such a pleasant place to listen to the Troy
military band in the afternoon, and the more or less vocal
concert in the evening.&nbsp; All the Saratoga world comes and
goes before us, as we sit there by day and by night, and we find
a perpetual interest in it.&nbsp; We go and look at the deer (a
herd of two, I think) behind their wire netting in the southward
valley of the park, and we would feed the trout in their blue
tank if we did not see them suffering with surfeit, and hanging
in motionless misery amid the clear water under a cloud of bread
crumbs.&nbsp; We are such devotees of the special attractions
offered from time to time that we do not miss a single balloon
ascension or pyrotechnic display.&nbsp; In fact, it happened to
me one summer that I studied so earnestly and so closely the
countenance of the lady who went up (in trunk-hose), in order to
make out just what were the emotions of a lady who went up every
afternoon in a balloon, that when we met near the end of the
season in Broadway I thought I must have seen her somewhere in
society, and took off my hat to her (she was not at the moment in
trunk-hose).&nbsp; We like going about to the great hotels, and
sponging on them for the music in the forenoon; we like the gaudy
shops of modes kept by artists whose addresses are French and
whose surnames are Irish; and the bazaars of the Armenians and
Japanese, whose rugs and bric-&agrave;-brac are not such bargains
as you would think.&nbsp; We even go to the races sometimes; we
are not sure it is quite right, but as we do not bet, and are
never decided as to which horse has won, it is perhaps not so
wrong as it might be.</p>
<p>Somehow I could not predicate these simple joys of the people
I have been talking of, for the very reason, that they were
themselves so simple.&nbsp; It was our sophistication which
enabled us to taste pleasures which would have been insipidities
to them.&nbsp; Their palates would have demanded other
flavours&mdash;social excitements, balls, flirtations, almost
escapades.&nbsp; I speak of the two women; the man, doubtless,
like most other Americans of his age, wanted nothing but to get
back to business in the small town where he was important; and
still more I speak of the young girl; for the young wife I
fancied very willing to go back to her house-keeping, and to be
staying on in Saratoga only on her friend&rsquo;s account.</p>
<h2><a name="page14"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
14</span>II</h2>
<p>I <span class="smcap">had</span> already made up my mind that
they had been the closest friends before one of them married, and
that the young wife still thought the young girl worthy of the
most splendid fate that marriage could have in store for any of
her sex.&nbsp; Women often make each other the idols of such
worship; but I could not have justified this lady&rsquo;s
adoration so far as it concerned the mental and moral qualities
of her friend, though I fully shared it in regard to her
beauty.&nbsp; To me she looked a little dull and a little
selfish, and I chose to think the husband modestly found her
selfish, if he were too modest to find her dull.</p>
<p>Yet, after all, I tacitly argued with him, why should we call
her selfish?&nbsp; It was perfectly right and fit that, as a
young girl with such great personal advantages, she should wish
to see the world&mdash;even to show herself to the
world,&mdash;and find in it some agreeable youth who should
admire her, and desire to make her his own for ever.&nbsp;
Compare this simple and natural longing with the insatiate greed
and ambition of one of our own sex, I urged him, and then talk to
me, if you can, of this poor girl&rsquo;s selfishness!&nbsp; A
young man has more egoism in an hour than a young girl has in her
whole life.&nbsp; She thinks she wishes some one to be devoted to
her, but she really wishes some one to let her be devoted to him;
and how passively, how negatively, she must manage to accomplish
her self-sacrifice!&nbsp; He, on the contrary, means to go
conquering and enslaving forward; to be in and out of love right
and left, and to end, after many years of triumph, in the
possession of the best and wisest and fairest of her sex.&nbsp; I
know the breed, my dear sir; I have been a young man
myself.&nbsp; We men have liberty, we have initiative; we are not
chaperoned; we can go to this one and that one freely and
fearlessly.&nbsp; But women must sit still, and be come to or
shied off from.&nbsp; They cannot cast the bold eye of interest;
they can at most bridle under it, and furtively respond from the
corner of the eye of weak hope and gentle deprecation.&nbsp; Be
patient, then, with this poor child if she darkles a little under
the disappointment of not finding Saratoga so personally gay as
she supposed it would be, and takes it out of you and your wife,
as if you were to blame for it, in something like sulks.</p>
<p>He remained silent under these tacit appeals, but at the end
he heaved a deep sigh, as he might if he were acknowledging their
justice, and were promising to do his very best in the
circumstances.&nbsp; His wife looked round at him, but did not
speak.&nbsp; In fact, they none of them spoke after the first
words of greeting to the girl, as I can very well testify; for I
sat eavesdropping with all my might, resolved not to lose a
syllable, and I am sure I lost none.</p>
<p>The young girl did not look round at that deep-drawn sigh of
the man&rsquo;s; she did not lift her head even when he cleared
his throat: but I was intent upon him, for I thought that these
sounds preluded an overture (I am not sure of the figure) to my
acquaintance, and in fact he actually asked, &ldquo;Do you know
just when the concert begins?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I was overjoyed at his question, for I was poignantly
interested in the little situation I had created, and I made
haste to answer: &ldquo;Well, nominally at eight o&rsquo;clock;
but the first half-hour is usually taken up in tuning the
instruments.&nbsp; If you get into the pavilion at a quarter to
nine you won&rsquo;t lose much.&nbsp; It isn&rsquo;t so bad when
it really begins.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man permitted himself a smile of the pleasure we Americans
all feel at having a thing understated in that way.&nbsp; His
wife asked timidly, &ldquo;Do we have to engage our seats in
the&mdash;pavilion?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no,&rdquo; I laughed; &ldquo;there&rsquo;s no such
rush as that.&nbsp; Haven&rsquo;t you been at the concerts
before?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man answered for her: &ldquo;We haven&rsquo;t been here
but a few days.&nbsp; I should think,&rdquo; he added to her,
&ldquo;it would be about as comfortable outside of the
house.&rdquo;&nbsp; I perceived that he maintained his
independence of my superior knowledge by refusing to say
&ldquo;pavilion&rdquo;; and in fact I do not know whether that is
the right name for the building myself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It will be hot enough anywhere,&rdquo; I assented, as
if the remark had been made to me; but here I drew the line out
of self-respect, and resolved that he should make the next
advances.</p>
<p>The young girl looked up at the first sound of my voice, and
verified me as the elderly man whom she had seen before; and then
she looked down at the water again.&nbsp; I understood, and I
freely forgave her.&nbsp; If my beard had been brown instead of
grey I should have been an adventure; but to the eye of girlhood
adventure can never wear a grey beard.&nbsp; I was truly sorry
for her; I could read in the pensive droop of her averted face
that I was again a disappointment.</p>
<p>They all three sat, without speaking again, in the mannerless
silence of Americans.&nbsp; The man was not going to feel bound
in further civility to me because I had civilly answered a
question of his.&nbsp; I divined that he would be glad to
withdraw from the overture he had made; he may have thought from
my readiness to meet him half way that I might be one of those
sharpers in whom Saratoga probably abounded.&nbsp; This did not
offend me; it amused me; I fancied his confusion if he could
suddenly know how helplessly and irreparably honest I was.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know but it&rsquo;s a little too damp
here, Rufus,&rdquo; said the wife.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know but it is,&rdquo; he answered; but
none of them moved, and none of them spoke again for some
minutes.&nbsp; Then the wife said again, but this time to the
friend, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know but it&rsquo;s a little too
damp here, Julia,&rdquo; and the friend answered, as the husband
had&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know but it is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I had two surprises in this slight event.&nbsp; I could never
have imagined that the girl had so brunette a name as Julia, or
anything less blond in sound than, say, Evadne, at the very
darkest; and I had made up my mind&mdash;Heaven knows
why&mdash;that her voice would be harsh.&nbsp; Perhaps I thought
it unfair that she should have a sweet voice added to all that
beauty and grace of hers; but she had a sweet voice, very tender
and melodious, with a plangent note in it that touched me and
charmed me.&nbsp; Beautiful and graceful as she was, she had
lacked atmosphere before, and now suddenly she had
atmosphere.&nbsp; I resolved to keep as near to these people as I
could, and not to leave the place as long as they stayed; but I
did not think it well to let them feel that I was
&aelig;sthetically shadowing them, and I got up and strolled away
toward the pavilion, keeping an eye in the back of my head upon
them.</p>
<p>I sat down in a commanding position, and watched the people
gathering for the concert; and in the drama of a group of Cubans,
or of South Americans, I almost forgot for a moment the pale idyl
of my compatriots at the kiosk.&nbsp; There was a short, stout
little Spanish woman speaking in the shapely sentences which the
Latin race everywhere delights in, and around her was an
increasing number of serious Spanish men, listening as if to
important things, and paying her that respectful attention which
always amuses and puzzles me.&nbsp; In view of what we think
their low estimate of women, I cannot make out whether it is a
personal tribute to some specific woman whom they regard
differently from all the rest of her sex, or whether they choose
to know in her for the nouce the abstract woman who is better
than woman in the concrete.&nbsp; I am sure I have never seen men
of any other race abandon themselves to such a luxury of respect
as these black and grey bearded Spaniards of leaden complexion
showed this dumpy personification of womanhood, with their
prominent eyes bent in homage upon her, and their hands trembling
with readiness to seize their hats off in reverence.&nbsp; It
appeared presently that the matter they were all canvassing so
devoutly was the question of where she should sit.&nbsp; It
seemed to be decided that she could not do better than sit just
at that point.&nbsp; When she actually took a chair the stately
convocation ended, and its members, with low obeisances,
dispersed themselves in different directions.&nbsp; They had
probably all been sitting with her the whole afternoon on the
verandah of the Everett House, where their race chiefly resorts
in Saratoga, and they were availing themselves of this occasion
to appear to be meeting her, after a long interval, in
society.</p>
<p>I said to myself that of course they believed Saratoga was
still that centre of American fashion which it once was, and that
they came and went every summer, probably in the belief that they
saw a great deal of social gaiety there.&nbsp; This made me
think, by a natural series of transitions, of the persons of my
American idyl, and I looked about the pavilion everywhere for
them without discovering, till the last, that they were just
behind me.</p>
<p>I found the fact touching.&nbsp; They had not wished to be in
any wise beholden to me, and had even tried to reject my friendly
readiness to know them better; but they had probably sought my
vicinity in a sense of their loneliness and helplessness, which
they hoped I would not divine, but which I divined
instantly.&nbsp; Still, I thought it best not to show any
consciousness of them, and we sat through the first part of the
concert without taking notice of one another.&nbsp; Then the man
leaned forward and touched me on the shoulder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will you let me take your programme a
minute?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, certainly,&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>He took it, and after a vague glance at it he passed it to his
wife, who gave it in turn to the young girl.&nbsp; She studied it
very briefly, and then, after a questioning look, offered it back
to me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Won&rsquo;t you keep it?&rdquo; I entreated.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve quite done with it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, thank you,&rdquo; she answered in her tender voice,
and she and the wife looked hard at the man, whom they seemed to
unite in pushing forward by that means.</p>
<p>He hemmed, and asked, &ldquo;Have you been in Saratoga
much?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, yes,&rdquo; I said; &ldquo;rather a good
deal.&nbsp; My wife and I have been here three or four
summers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At the confession of my married state, which this statement
implicated, the women exchanged a glance, I fancied, of triumph,
as if they had been talking about me, and I had now confirmed the
ground they had taken concerning me.&nbsp; Then they joined in
goading the man on again with their eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Which hotel,&rdquo; he asked, &ldquo;should you say had
the most going on?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The young girl and the wife transferred their gaze to me, with
an intensified appeal in it.&nbsp; The man looked away with a
certain shame&mdash;the shame of a man who feels that his wife
has made him make an ass of himself.&nbsp; I tried to treat his
question, by the quantity and quality of my answer, as one of the
most natural things in the world; and I probably deceived them
all by this effort, though I am sure that I was most truthful and
just concerning the claims of the different hotels to be the
centre of excitement.&nbsp; I thought I had earned the right to
ask at the end, &ldquo;Are you stopping at the Grand
Union?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; he said; and he mentioned one of the smaller
hotels, which depend upon the great houses for the entertainment
of their guests.&nbsp; &ldquo;Are you there?&rdquo; he asked,
meaning the Grand Union.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh no,&rdquo; I said; &ldquo;we couldn&rsquo;t do that
sort of thing, even if we wanted.&rdquo;&nbsp; And in my turn I
named the modest hotel where we were, and said that I thought it
by all odds the pleasantest place in Saratoga.&nbsp; &ldquo;But I
can&rsquo;t say,&rdquo; I added, &ldquo;that there is a great
deal going on there, either.&nbsp; If you want that sort of thing
you will have to go to some of the great hotels.&nbsp; We have
our little amusements, but they&rsquo;re all rather
mild.&rdquo;&nbsp; I kept talking to the man, but really
addressing myself to the women.&nbsp; &ldquo;There&rsquo;s
something nearly every evening: prestidigitating, or
elocutioning, or a little concert, or charades, or impromptu
theatricals, or something of that sort.&nbsp; I can&rsquo;t say
there&rsquo;s dancing, though really, I suppose, if any one
wanted to dance there would be dancing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I was aware that the women listened intelligently, even if the
man did not.&nbsp; The wife drew a long breath, and said,
&ldquo;It must be very pleasant.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl said&mdash;rather more hungrily, I
fancied&mdash;&ldquo;Yes, indeed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know why their interest should have prompted me
to go on and paint the lily a little, but I certainly did
so.&nbsp; I did not stop till the music began again, and I had to
stop.&nbsp; By the time the piece was finished I had begun to
have my misgivings, and I profited by the brief interval of
silence to say to the young girl, &ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t have
you think we are a whirl of gaiety exactly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh no,&rdquo; she answered pathetically, as if she were
quite past expecting that or anything like it.</p>
<p>We were silent again.&nbsp; At the end of the next piece they
all rose, and the wife said timidly to me, &ldquo;Well,
good-evening,&rdquo; as if she might be venturing too far; and
her husband came to her rescue with &ldquo;Well, good-evening,
sir.&rdquo;&nbsp; The young girl merely bowed.</p>
<p>I did not stay much longer, for I was eager to get home and
tell my wife about my adventure, which seemed to me of a very
rare and thrilling kind.&nbsp; I believed that if I could present
it to her duly, it would interest her as much as it had
interested me.&nbsp; But somehow, as I went on with it in the
lamplight of her room, it seemed to lose colour and specific
character.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are always making up these romances about young
girls being off and disappointed of a good time ever since we saw
that poor little Kitty Ellison with her cousins at
Niagara,&rdquo; said Mrs. March.&nbsp; &ldquo;You seem to have it
on the brain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because it&rsquo;s the most tragical thing in the
world, and the commonest in our transition state,&rdquo; I
retorted.&nbsp; I was somewhat exasperated to have my romance
treated as so stale a situation, though I was conscious now that
it did want perfect novelty.&nbsp; &ldquo;It&rsquo;s precisely
for that reason that I like to break my heart over it.&nbsp; I
see it every summer, and it keeps me in a passion of pity.&nbsp;
Something ought to be done about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, don&rsquo;t <i>you</i> try to do anything, Basil,
unless you write to the newspapers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;that if the newspapers
could be got to take hold of it, perhaps something might be
done.&rdquo;&nbsp; The notion amused me; I went on to play with
it, and imagined Saratoga, by a joint effort of the leading
journals, recolonised with the social life that once made it the
paradise of young people.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have been writing to the children,&rdquo; said my
wife, &ldquo;and telling them to stay on at York Harbour if the
Herricks want them so much.&nbsp; They would hate it here.&nbsp;
You say the girl looked cross.&nbsp; I can&rsquo;t exactly
imagine a cross goddess.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There were lots of cross goddesses,&rdquo; I said
rather crossly myself; for I saw that, after having trodden my
romance in the dust, she was willing I should pick it up again
and shake it off, and I wished to show her that I was not to be
so lightly appeased.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps I was thinking of angels,&rdquo; she
murmured.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I distinctly didn&rsquo;t say she was an angel,&rdquo;
I returned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, come, Basil; I see you&rsquo;re keeping something
back.&nbsp; What did you try to do for those people?&nbsp; Did
you tell them where you were stopping?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I did.&nbsp; They asked me, and I told
them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you brag the place up?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;On the contrary, I understated its merits.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, very well, then,&rdquo; she said, quite as if I had
confessed my guilt; &ldquo;they will come here, and you will have
your romance on your hands for the rest of the month.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;m thankful we&rsquo;re going away the first of
August.&rdquo;</p>

28</span>III</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> next afternoon, while we were
sitting in the park waiting for the Troy band to begin playing,
and I was wondering just when they would reach the
&ldquo;Washington Post March,&rdquo; which I like because I can
always be sure of it, my unknown friends came strolling our
way.&nbsp; The man looked bewildered and bored, with something of
desperation in his troubled eye, and his wife looked tired and
disheartened.&nbsp; The young girl, still in white duck, wore the
same air of passive injury I had noted in her the night
before.&nbsp; Their faces all three lighted up at sight of me;
but they faded again at the cold and meagre response I made to
their smiles under correction of my wife&rsquo;s fears of
them.&nbsp; I own it was base of me; but I had begun to feel
myself that it might be too large a contract to attempt their
consolation, and, in fact, after one is fifty scarcely any
romance will keep overnight.</p>
<p>My wife glanced from them to me, and read my cowardly mind;
but she waited till they passed, as they did after an involuntary
faltering in front of us, and were keeping on down the path,
looking at the benches, which were filled on either hand.&nbsp;
She said, &ldquo;Weren&rsquo;t those your friends?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They were the persons of my romance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No matter.&nbsp; Go after them instantly and bring them
back here, poor things.&nbsp; We can make room for
them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I rose.&nbsp; &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t this a little too
idyllic?&nbsp; Aren&rsquo;t you rather overdoing it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t speak to me, Basil!&nbsp; I never heard of
anything so atrocious.&nbsp; Go on your knees to them if they
refuse!&nbsp; They can sit here with me, and you and he can
stand.&nbsp; Fly!&rdquo;</p>
<p>I knew she was punishing me for her own reluctance; but I
flew, in that sense of the term, and easily overhauled them in
the tangle of people coming and going in the path, and the
nursemaids pushing their perambulators in either direction.&nbsp;
Hat in hand I delivered my message.&nbsp; I could see that it
gave the women great pleasure and the man some doubt.&nbsp; His
mouth fell open a little; their cheeks flushed and their eyes
shone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know as we better,&rdquo; the wife
hesitated; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid we&rsquo;ll crowd
you.&rdquo;&nbsp; And she looked wistfully toward my wife.&nbsp;
The young girl looked at her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not at all!&rdquo; I cried.&nbsp; &ldquo;There&rsquo;s
an abundance of room.&nbsp; My wife&rsquo;s keeping the places
for you,&rdquo;&mdash;in fact, I saw her putting her arm out
along the bench, and explaining to a couple who had halted in
front of her that the seats were taken&mdash;&ldquo;and
she&rsquo;ll be disappointed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; the woman consented, with a little sigh of
triumph that touched me, and reanimated all my interest in her
and in her friend.&nbsp; She said, with a sort of shy,
instinctive politeness, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know as you and Mr.
Deering got acquainted last night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My name is March,&rdquo; I said, and I shook the hand
of Mr. Deering.&nbsp; It was rather thick.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And this&mdash;is our friend,&rdquo; Mrs. Peering went
on, in presentation of me to the young lady, &ldquo;Miss Gage,
that&rsquo;s come with us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I was delighted that I had guessed their relative qualities so
perfectly, and when we arrived at Mrs. March I glibly presented
them.&nbsp; My wife was all that I could have wished her to be of
sympathetic and intelligent.&nbsp; She did not overdo it by
shaking hands, but she made places for the ladies, smiling
cordially; and Mrs. Deering made Miss Gage take the seat between
them.&nbsp; Her husband and I stood awhile in front of them, and
then I said we would go off and find chairs somewhere.</p>
<p>We did not find any till we had climbed to the upland at the
south-east of the park, and then only two iron ones, which it was
useless to think of transporting.&nbsp; But there was no reason
why we should not sit in them where they were: we could keep the
ladies in plain sight, and I could not mistake &ldquo;Washington
Post&rdquo; when the band came to it.&nbsp; Mr. Deering sank into
one of the chairs with a sigh of satisfaction which seemed to
complete itself when he discovered in the thick grass at his feet
a twig from one of the tall, slim pines above us.&nbsp; He bent
over for it, and then, as he took out his penknife and clicked
open a blade to begin whittling, he cast up a critical glance at
the trees.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pretty nice pines,&rdquo; he said; and he put his hand
on the one next to us with a sort of appreciation that interested
me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; the trees of Saratoga are the glory of the
place,&rdquo; I returned.&nbsp; &ldquo;I never saw them grow
anywhere else so tall and slim.&nbsp; It doesn&rsquo;t seem the
effect of crowding either.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s as if there was some
chemical force in the soil that shot them up.&nbsp; They&rsquo;re
like rockets that haven&rsquo;t left the ground yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the crowding,&rdquo; he said seriously, as
if the subject were not to be trifled with.&nbsp;
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the habit of all these trees&mdash;pines and
oaks and maples, I don&rsquo;t care what they are&mdash;to
spread, and that&rsquo;s what we tell our customers.&nbsp; Give
the trees plenty of room; don&rsquo;t plant &rsquo;em too thick
if you want to get all the good out of &rsquo;em.&rdquo;&nbsp; As
if he saw a question in my eye, he went on: &ldquo;We do a
forest-tree business exclusively; these shade-trees, and walnuts,
hickories, chestnuts, and all kinds.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s a big
trade, getting to be, and growing all the time.&nbsp; Folks have
begun to find out what fools they were to destroy the forests,
and the children want to buy back what the fathers threw
away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I scarcely needed to prompt him; he was only too glad to talk
on about his business, and he spoke with a sort of homesick
fondness.&nbsp; He told me that he had his nurseries at De Witt
Point, up on the St. Lawrence, where he could raise stock hardy
enough for any climate, and ship by land or water.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got to be getting home right away
now,&rdquo; he said finally, clicking his knife-blade half shut
and open with his thumb.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s about time for our evergreen trade, and I
don&rsquo;t want the trees to stay a minute in the ground after
the middle of the month.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Won&rsquo;t the ladies find it hard to tear themselves
away from the gaieties of Saratoga?&rdquo; I asked with apparent
vagueness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, that&rsquo;s it,&rdquo; said Mr. Deering; and he
shut his knife and slipped it into his pocket, in order to take
his knee between his clasped hands and lift his leg from the
ground.&nbsp; I have noticed that this is a philosophical
attitude with some people, and I was prepared by it for some
thoughtful generalising from my companion.&nbsp; &ldquo;Women
would be willing to stay on in a place for a year to see if
something wouldn&rsquo;t happen; and if you take &rsquo;em away
before anything happens, they&rsquo;ll always think that if
they&rsquo;d stayed something would have happened the next day,
or maybe the day they left.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He stared upward into the pine boughs, and I said: &ldquo;Yes,
that&rsquo;s so.&nbsp; I suppose we should be like them if we had
the same conditions.&nbsp; Their whole life is an expectation of
something to happen.&nbsp; Men have the privilege of making
things happen&mdash;or trying to.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t know as I want to criticise
&rsquo;em.&nbsp; As you say, I guess <i>we</i> should be just
so.&rdquo;&nbsp; He dropped his leg, and bent over as if to
examine the grass; he ended by taking a blade of it between his
teeth before he spoke again, with his head still down.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to hurry &rsquo;em; I want to give
&rsquo;em a fair show now we&rsquo;re here, and I&rsquo;ll let
the stock go as long as I can.&nbsp; But I don&rsquo;t see very
much gaiety around.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I laughed.&nbsp; &ldquo;Why, it&rsquo;s all gaiety, in one
way.&nbsp; Saratoga is a perpetual Fourth of July, we
think.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh yes; there&rsquo;s enough going on, and my wife and
me we could enjoy it first rate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If the young lady could?&rdquo; I ventured, with a
smile of sympathetic intelligence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, yes.&nbsp; You see, we don&rsquo;t know anybody,
and I suppose we didn&rsquo;t take that into account.&nbsp; Well,
I suppose it&rsquo;s like this: they thought it would be easy to
get acquainted in the hotel, and commence having a good time
right away.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t know; my wife had the idea when
they cooked it up amongst &rsquo;em that she was to come with
us.&nbsp; But I <i>swear I</i> don&rsquo;t know how to go about
it.&nbsp; I can&rsquo;t seem to make up my mouth to speak to
folks first; and then you can&rsquo;t tell whether a man
ain&rsquo;t a gambler, or on for the horse-races anyway.&nbsp; So
we&rsquo;ve been here a week now, and you&rsquo;re the first ones
we&rsquo;ve spoken to besides the waiters since we
came.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I couldn&rsquo;t help laughing, their experience was so
exactly as I had imagined it when I first saw this disconsolate
party.&nbsp; In my triumph at my own penetration, I would not
have had their suffering in the past one pang the less; but the
simple frankness of his confession fixed me in the wish that the
future might be brighter for them.&nbsp; I thought myself
warranted by my wife&rsquo;s imprudence in taking a step toward
their further intimacy on my own account, and I said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, perhaps I ought to tell you that I haven&rsquo;t
been inside the Saratoga Club or bet on the races since
I&rsquo;ve been here.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s my name in
full,&rdquo;&mdash;and I gave him my card,&mdash;&ldquo;and
I&rsquo;m in the literary line; that is, I&rsquo;m the editor of
a magazine in New York&mdash;the <i>Every Other
Week</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh yes; I know who you are,&rdquo; said my companion,
with my card in his hand.&nbsp; &ldquo;Fact is, I was round at
your place this morning trying to get rooms, and the clerk told
me all about you from my description.&nbsp; I felt as mean as
pu&rsquo;sley goin&rsquo;; seemed to be takin&rsquo; kind of an
advantage of you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not at all; it&rsquo;s a public house,&rdquo; I
interrupted; but I thought I should be stronger with Mrs. March
if I did not give the fact away to her, and I resolved to keep
it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But they couldn&rsquo;t rest easy till I tried, and I
was more than half glad there wasn&rsquo;t any rooms.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m very sorry,&rdquo; I said; and I indulged
a real regret from the vantage I had.&nbsp; &ldquo;It would have
been very pleasant to have you there.&nbsp; Perhaps
later&mdash;we shall be giving up our rooms at the end of the
month.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; he said, with a long breath.&nbsp; &ldquo;If
I&rsquo;ve got to leave &rsquo;em, I guess it&rsquo;ll be just as
well to leave &rsquo;em where they&rsquo;re acquainted with the
house anyway.&rdquo;&nbsp; His remark betrayed a point in his
thinking which had not perhaps been reached in his talk with the
ladies.&nbsp; &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a quiet place, and they&rsquo;re
used to it; and I guess they wouldn&rsquo;t want to stay through
the rest of the month, quite.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t believe my wife
would, anyway.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He did not say this very confidently, but hopefully rather,
and I thought it afforded me an opening to find out something yet
more definite about the ladies.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Miss Gage is remarkably fine-looking,&rdquo; I
began.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Think so?&rdquo; he answered.&nbsp; &ldquo;Well, so
does my wife.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t know as I like her style
exactly,&rdquo; he said, with a kind of latent grudge.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Her style is magnificent,&rdquo; I insisted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, maybe so.&nbsp; I guess she&rsquo;s good enough
looking, if that&rsquo;s what you mean.&nbsp; But I think
it&rsquo;s always a kind of a mistake for three persons to come
off together, I don&rsquo;t care who they are.&nbsp; Then
there&rsquo;s three opinions.&nbsp; She&rsquo;s a nice girl, and
a good girl, and she don&rsquo;t put herself forward.&nbsp; But
when you&rsquo;ve got a young lady on your hands, you&rsquo;ve
<i>got</i> her, and you feel bound to keep doin&rsquo; something
for her all the time; and if you don&rsquo;t know what to do
yourself, and your wife can&rsquo;t tell&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>I added intelligently, &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, that&rsquo;s just where it is.&nbsp; Sometimes I
wish the whole dumb town would burn up.&rdquo;&nbsp; I laughed
and laughed; and my friend, having begun to unpack his heart,
went on to ease it of the rest of its load.&nbsp; I had not
waited for this before making some reflections concerning him,
but I now formulated them to myself.&nbsp; He really had none of
that reserve I had attributed to him the night before; it was
merely caution and this is the case with most country
people.&nbsp; They are cautious, but not reserved; if they think
they can trust you, they keep back none of their affairs; and
this is the American character, for we are nearly all country
people.&nbsp; I understood him perfectly when he said, &ldquo;I
ruther break stone than go through what I have been through the
last week!&nbsp; You understand how it is.&nbsp;
&rsquo;Tain&rsquo;t as if she said anything; I wish she would;
but you feel all the while that it ain&rsquo;t what she expected
it to be, and you feel as if it was you that was to blame for the
failure.&nbsp; By George! if any man was to come along and make
an offer for my contract I would sell out cheap.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s
worse because my wife asked her to come, and thought she was
doin&rsquo; her all kinds of a favour to let her.&nbsp;
They&rsquo;ve always been together, and when we talked of coming
to Saratoga this summer, nothing would do my wife but Julia must
come with us.&nbsp; Her and her father usually take a trip off
somewhere in the hot weather, but this time he couldn&rsquo;t
leave; president of our National Bank, and president of the
village, too.&rdquo;&nbsp; He threw in the fact of these
dignities explanatorily, but with a willingness, I could see,
that it should affect me.&nbsp; He went on: &ldquo;They&rsquo;re
kind of connections of my first wife&rsquo;s.&nbsp; Well,
she&rsquo;s a nice girl; too nice, I guess, to get along very
fast.&nbsp; I see girls all the way along down gettin&rsquo;
acquainted on the cars and boats&mdash;we come east on the
Ogdensburg road to Rouse&rsquo;s Point, and then took the boat
down Lake Champlain and Lake George&mdash;but she always seemed
to hold back.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t know&rsquo;s she&rsquo;s proud
either; I can&rsquo;t make it out.&nbsp; It balls my wife all up,
too.&nbsp; I tell her she&rsquo;s fretted off all the good her
trip&rsquo;s goin&rsquo; to do her before she got it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He laughed ruefully, and just then the band began to play the
&ldquo;Washington Post.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What tune&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; he demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Washington Post,&rsquo;&rdquo; I said, proud of
knowing it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;By George! that tune goes right to a fellow&rsquo;s
legs, don&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the new march,&rdquo; I said.</p>
<p>He listened with a simple joy in it, and his pleasure
strengthened the mystic bond which had formed itself between us
through the confidences he had made me, so flatteringly
corroborative of all my guesses concerning him and his party.</p>
<h2><a name="page41"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
41</span>IV</h2>
<p>I <span class="smcap">longed</span> to have the chance of
bragging to my wife; but this chance did not come till the
concert was quite over, after I rejoined her with my companion,
and she could take leave of them all without seeming to abandon
them.&nbsp; Then I judged it best to let her have the word; for I
knew by the way she ran her hand through my arm, and began
pushing me along out of earshot, that she was full of it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Basil, I think that is the sweetest and simplest
and kindest creature in the world, and I&rsquo;m perfectly in
love with her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I did not believe somehow that she meant the girl, but I
thought it best merely to suggest, &ldquo;There are
two.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know very well which I mean, and I would do
anything I could for her.&nbsp; She&rsquo;s got a difficult
problem before her, and I pity her.&nbsp; The girl&rsquo;s very
well, and she <i>is</i> a beauty; and I suppose she <i>has</i>
been having a dull time, and of course you couldn&rsquo;t please
Mrs. Deering half so well as by doing something for her
friend.&nbsp; I suppose you&rsquo;re feeling very proud that
they&rsquo;re just what you divined.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not at all; I&rsquo;m so used to divining people.&nbsp;
How did you know I knew it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I saw you talking to him, and I knew you were pumping
him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pumping?&nbsp; He asked nothing better than to
flow.&nbsp; He would put to shame the provoked spontaneity of any
spring in Saratoga.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, did he say that he was going to leave them
here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He would like to do it&mdash;yes.&nbsp; He was very
sweet and simple and kind, too, Isabel.&nbsp; He complained
bitterly of the goddess, and all but said she sulked.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; said my wife.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I think, considering, that she is rather amiable.&nbsp;
She brightened up more and more.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That was prosperity, or the hope of it, my dear.&nbsp;
Nothing illumines us like the prospect of pleasant things.&nbsp;
She took you for society smiling upon her, and of course she
smiled back.&nbsp; But it&rsquo;s only the first smile of
prosperity that cheers.&nbsp; If it keeps on smiling it ends by
making us dissatisfied again.&nbsp; When people are getting into
society they are very glad; when they have got in they seem to be
rather gloomy.&nbsp; We mustn&rsquo;t let these things go too
far.&nbsp; Now that you&rsquo;ve got your friends in good humour,
the right way is to drop them&mdash;to cut them dead when you
meet them, to look the other way.&nbsp; That will send them home
perfectly radiant.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nonsense!&nbsp; I am going to do all I can for
them.&nbsp; What do you think we can do?&nbsp; They haven&rsquo;t
the first idea how to amuse themselves here.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s a
miracle they ever got that dress the girl is wearing.&nbsp; They
just made a bold dash because they saw it in a dressmaker&rsquo;s
window the first day, and she had to have something.&nbsp;
It&rsquo;s killingly becoming to her; but I don&rsquo;t believe
they know it, and they don&rsquo;t begin to know how cheap it
was: it was simply <i>thrown</i> away.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m going
shopping with them in the morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But now the question is, what we can do to give them
some little glimpse of social gaiety.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s what
they&rsquo;ve come for.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We were passing the corner of a large enclosure which seems
devoted in Saratoga to the most distracting of its pleasures, and
I said: &ldquo;Well, we might give them a turn on the circular
railway or the switchback; or we could take them to the Punch and
Judy drama, or get their fortunes told in the seeress&rsquo;s
tent, or let them fire in the shooting-gallery, or buy some
sweet-grass baskets of the Indians; and there is the pop-corn and
the lemonade.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will tell you what,&rdquo; said Mrs. March, who had
not been listening to a word I said; for if she had heard me she
would not have had patience with my ironical suggestions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, what?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Or, no; that wouldn&rsquo;t do, either.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad you don&rsquo;t approve of the notion,
on second thoughts.&nbsp; I didn&rsquo;t like it from the
beginning, and I didn&rsquo;t even know what it was.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We could have them up to the house this evening, and
introduce them to some of our friends,&mdash;only there
isn&rsquo;t a young man in the whole place,&mdash;and have them
stay to the charades.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you think,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;of their
having come up this morning and tried to get rooms at our
house?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; they told me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And don&rsquo;t you call that rather
forth-putting?&nbsp; It seems to me that it was taking a mean
advantage of my brags.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was perfectly innocent in them.&nbsp; But now,
dearest, don&rsquo;t be tiresome.&nbsp; I know that you like them
as well as I do, and I will take all your little teasing
affectations for granted.&nbsp; The question is, what can we do
for them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the answer is, I don&rsquo;t in the least
know.&nbsp; There isn&rsquo;t any society life at Saratoga that I
can see; and if there is, we are not in it.&nbsp; How could we
get any one else in?&nbsp; I see that&rsquo;s what you&rsquo;re
aiming at.&nbsp; Those public socialities at the big hotels they
could get into as well as we could; but they wouldn&rsquo;t be
anywhere when they got there, and they wouldn&rsquo;t know what
to do.&nbsp; You know what hollow mockeries those things
are.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t you remember that hop we went to with the
young Braceys the first summer?&nbsp; If those girls hadn&rsquo;t
waltzed with each other they wouldn&rsquo;t have danced a step
the whole evening.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know, I know,&rdquo; sighed my wife; &ldquo;it was
terrible.&nbsp; But these people are so very unworldly that
don&rsquo;t you think they could be deluded into the belief that
they were seeing society if we took a little trouble?&nbsp; You
used to be so inventive!&nbsp; You could think up something now
if you tried.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear, a girl knows beyond all the arts of
hoodwinking whether she&rsquo;s having a good time, and your
little scheme of passing off one of those hotel hops for a
festivity would never work in the world.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I think it is too bad!&nbsp; What has become of
all the easy gaiety there used to be in the world?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It has been starched and ironed out of it,
apparently.&nbsp; Saratoga is still trying to do the good old
American act, with its big hotels and its heterogeneous hops, and
I don&rsquo;t suppose there&rsquo;s ever such a thing as a
society person at any of them.&nbsp; That wouldn&rsquo;t be so
bad.&nbsp; But the unsociety people seem to be afraid of one
another.&nbsp; They feel that there is something in the
air&mdash;something they don&rsquo;t and can&rsquo;t understand;
something alien, that judges their old-fashioned American impulse
to be sociable, and contemns it.&nbsp; No; we can&rsquo;t do
anything for our hapless friends&mdash;I can hardly call them our
acquaintances.&nbsp; We must avoid them, and keep them merely as
a pensive colour in our own vivid memories of Saratoga.&nbsp; If
we made them have a good time, and sent them on their way
rejoicing, I confess that I should feel myself distinctly a
loser.&nbsp; As it is, they&rsquo;re a strain of melancholy
poetry in my life, of music in the minor key.&nbsp; I shall
always associate their pathos with this hot summer weather, and I
shall think of them whenever the thermometer registers
eighty-nine.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t you see the advantage of
that?&nbsp; I believe I can ultimately get some literature out of
them.&nbsp; If I can think of a fitting fable for them Fulkerson
will feature it in <i>Every Other Week</i>.&nbsp; He&rsquo;ll get
out a Saratoga number, and come up here and strike the hotels and
springs for ad&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Mrs. March, &ldquo;I wish I had never
seen them; and it&rsquo;s all your fault, Basil.&nbsp; Of course,
when you played upon my sympathies so about them, I
couldn&rsquo;t help feeling interested in them.&nbsp; We are a
couple of romantic old geese, my dear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not at all, or at least I&rsquo;m not.&nbsp; I simply
used these people conjecturally to give myself an agreeable
pang.&nbsp; I didn&rsquo;t want to know anything more about them
than I imagined, and I certainly didn&rsquo;t dream of doing
anything for them.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ll spoil everything if you
turn them from fiction into fact, and try to manipulate their
destiny.&nbsp; Let them alone; they will work it out for
themselves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know I can&rsquo;t let them alone now,&rdquo; she
lamented.&nbsp; &ldquo;I am not one of those who can give
themselves an agreeable pang with the unhappiness of their
fellow-creatures.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m not satisfied to study them; I
want to relieve them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She went on to praise herself to my disadvantage, as I notice
wives will with their husbands, and I did not attempt to deny her
this source of consolation.&nbsp; But when she ended by saying,
&ldquo;I believe I shall send you alone,&rdquo; and explained
that she had promised Mrs. Deering we would come to their hotel
for them after tea, and go with them to hear the music at the
United States and the Grand Union, I protested.&nbsp; I said that
I always felt too sneaking when I was prowling round those hotels
listening to their proprietary concerts, and I was aware of
looking so sneaking that I expected every moment to be ordered
off their piazzas.&nbsp; As for convoying a party of three
strangers about alone, I should certainly not do it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not if I&rsquo;ve a headache?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not if you&rsquo;ve a headache.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, very well, then.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are you two quarrelling about?&rdquo; cried a gay
voice behind us, and we looked round into the laughing eyes of
Miss Dale.&nbsp; She was the one cottager we knew in Saratoga,
but when we were with her we felt that we knew everybody, so
hospitable was the sense of world which her kindness exhaled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was Mrs. March who was quarrelling,&rdquo; I
said.&nbsp; &ldquo;I was only trying to convince her that she was
wrong, and of course one has to lift one&rsquo;s voice.&nbsp; I
hope I hadn&rsquo;t the effect of halloaing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I merely heard you above the steam harmonicon at
the switchback,&rdquo; said Miss Dale.&nbsp; &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t
know whether you call <i>that</i> holloaing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Miss Dale,&rdquo; said my wife, &ldquo;we are in
such a fatal&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pickle,&rdquo; I suggested, and she instantly adopted
the word in her extremity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&mdash;pickle with some people that Providence has
thrown in our way, and that we want to do something for&rdquo;;
and in a labyrinth of parentheses that no man could have found
his way into or out of, she possessed Miss Dale of the whole
romantic fact.&nbsp; &ldquo;It was Mr. March, of course, who
first discovered them,&rdquo; she concluded, in plaintive
accusation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Poor Mr. March!&rdquo; cried Miss Dale.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Well, it is a pathetic case, but it isn&rsquo;t the only
one, if that&rsquo;s any comfort.&nbsp; Saratoga is reeking with
just such forlornities the whole summer long; but I can quite
understand how you feel about it, Mrs. March.&rdquo;&nbsp; We
came to a corner, and she said abruptly: &ldquo;Excuse my
interrupting your quarrel!&nbsp; Not quite so <i>loud</i>, Mr.
March!&rdquo; and she flashed back a mocking look at me as she
skurried off down the street with astonishing rapidity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How perfectly heartless!&rdquo; cried my wife.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I certainly thought she would suggest
something&mdash;offer to do something.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I relied upon her, too,&rdquo; I said; &ldquo;but now I
have my doubts whether she was really going down that street till
she saw that it was the best way to escape.&nbsp; We&rsquo;re
certainly in trouble, my dear, if people avoid us in this
manner.&rdquo;</p>
<h2><a name="page51"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 51</span>V</h2>
<p>&ldquo;I <span class="smcap">am</span> doing it entirely on
Mrs. Deering&rsquo;s I account,&rdquo; said my wife that evening
after tea, as we walked down the side-street that descended from
our place to Broadway.&nbsp; &ldquo;She has that girl on her
hands, and I know she must be at her wits&rsquo; end.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I do it entirely on Deering&rsquo;s account,&rdquo;
I retorted.&nbsp; &ldquo;He has both of those women on <i>his</i>
hands.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We emerged into the glistening thoroughfare in front of the
vast hotels, and I was struck, as I never fail to be, with its
futile and unmeaning splendour.&nbsp; I think there is nothing in
our dun-coloured civilisation prettier than that habit the ladies
have in Saratoga of going out on the street after dark in their
bare heads.&nbsp; When I first saw them wandering about so in the
glitter of the shop-windows and the fitful glare of the electrics
everywhere, I thought they must be some of those
Spanish-Americans mistaking the warm, dry air of the Northern
night for that of their own latitudes; but when I came up with
them I could hear, if I could not see, that they were of our own
race.&nbsp; Those flat and shapeless tones could come through the
noses of no other.&nbsp; The beauty and the elegance were also
ours, and the fearless trust of circumstance.&nbsp; They
sauntered up and down before the gaunt, high porticoes of the
hotels, as much at home as they could have been in their own
houses, and in much the same dress as if they had been receiving
there.&nbsp; The effect is one of incomparable cheer, and is a
promise of social brilliancy which Saratoga no more keeps than
she does that of her other characteristic aspects; say the
forenoon effect of the same thoroughfare, with the piazzas banked
with the hotel guests, and the street full of the light equipages
which seem peculiar to the place passing and repassing, in the
joyous sunlight and out of it, on the leaf-flecked street.&nbsp;
Even the public carriages of Saratoga have a fresh, unjaded air;
and to issue from the railway station in the midst of those
buoyant top-phaetons and surreys, with their light-limbed horses,
is to be thrilled by some such insensate expectation of pleasure
as fills the heart of a boy at his first sally into the
world.&nbsp; I always expect to find my lost youth waiting for me
around the corner of the United States Hotel, and I accuse myself
of some fault if it disappoints me, as it always does.&nbsp; I
can imagine what gaudy hopes by day and by night the bright
staging of the potential drama must awaken in the breast of a
young girl when she first sees it, and how blank she must feel
when the curtain goes down and there has been no play.&nbsp; It
was a real anguish to me when that young girl with the Deerings
welcomed my wife and me with a hopeful smile, as if we were the
<i>dramatis person&aelig;</i>, and now the performance must be
going to begin.&nbsp; I could see how much our chance
acquaintance had brightened the perspective for her, and how
eagerly she had repaired all her illusions; and I thought how
much better it would have been if she had been left to the dull
and spiritless resignation in which I had first seen her.&nbsp;
From that there could no fall, at least, and now she had risen
from it only to sink again.</p>
<p>But, in fact, the whole party seemed falsely cheered by the
event of the afternoon; and in the few moments that we sat with
them on their verandah, before going to the music at the Grand
Union, I could hear the ladies laughing together, while Deering
joyously unfolded to me his plan of going home the next morning
and leaving his wife and Miss Gage behind him.&nbsp; &ldquo;They
will stay in this hotel&mdash;they might as well&mdash;and I
guess they can get along.&nbsp; My wife feels more acquainted
since she met Mrs. March, and I shan&rsquo;t feel so much like
leavin&rsquo; her among strangers here I don&rsquo;t know when
she&rsquo;s taken such a fancy to any one as she has to your
wife, or Miss Gage either.&nbsp; I guess she&rsquo;ll want to ask
her about the stores.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I said that I believed the fancy was mutual, and that there
was nothing my wife liked better than telling people about
stores.&nbsp; I added, in generalisation, that when a woman had
spent all her own money on dress, it did her quite as much good
to see other women spending theirs; and Deering said he guessed
that was about so.&nbsp; He gave me a push on the shoulder to
make me understand how keenly he appreciated the joke, and I
perceived that we had won his heart too.</p>
<p>We joined the ladies, and I thought that my sufferings for her
authorised me to attach myself more especially to Miss Gage, and
to find out all I could about her.&nbsp; We walked ahead of the
others, and I was aware of her making believe that it was quite
the same as if she were going to the music with a young
man.&nbsp; Not that she seemed disposed to trifle with my grey
hairs; I quickly saw that this would not be in character with
her; but some sort of illusion was essential to her youth, and
she could not help rejuvenating me.&nbsp; This was quite like the
goddess she looked, I reflected, but otherwise she was not
formidably divine; and, in fact, I suppose the goddesses were,
after all, only nice girls at heart.&nbsp; This one, at any rate,
I decided, was a very nice girl when she was not sulking; and she
was so brightened by her little adventure, which was really no
adventure, that I could not believe I had ever seen her
sulking.</p>
<p>The hotel people did not keep us from going into the court of
the hotel, as I was afraid they might, and we all easily found
places.&nbsp; In the pauses of the music I pointed out such
notables and characters as I saw about us, and tried to possess
her of as much of the Saratoga world as I knew.&nbsp; It was
largely there in that bold evidence it loves, and in that social
solitude to which the Saratoga of the hotels condemns the
denizens of her world.&nbsp; I do not mean that the Saratoga
crowd is at all a fast-looking crowd.&nbsp; There are sporting
people and gamblers; but the great mass of the frequenters are
plain, honest Americans, out upon a holiday from all parts of the
country, and of an innocence too inveterate to have grasped the
fact that there is no fashion in Saratoga now but the fashion of
the ladies&rsquo; dresses.&nbsp; These, I must say, are of the
newest and prettiest; the dressing of the women always strikes me
there.&nbsp; My companion was eager to recognise the splendours
which she had heard of, and I pointed out an old lady by the
door, who sat there displaying upon her vast person an assortment
of gems and jewels which she seemed as personally indifferent to
as if she were a show-window, and I was glad to have the girl
shrink from the spectacle in a kind of mute alarm.&nbsp; I tried
to make her share my pleasure in a group of Cubans&mdash;fat
father, fat mother, fat daughter&mdash;who came down the walk
toward us in the halo of tropical tradition; but she had not the
taste for olives, and I saw that I failed to persuade her of the
&aelig;sthetic value of this alien element among us.&nbsp; She
apparently could do almost as little with some old figures of
bygone beaus spectrally revisiting the hotel haunts of their
youth; but she was charmed with the sylvan loveliness of that
incomparable court.&nbsp; It is, in fact, a park of the tall,
slim Saratoga trees enclosed by the quadrangle of the hotel,
exquisitely kept, and with its acres of greensward now showing
their colour vividly in the light of the electrics, which shone
from all sides on the fountain flashing and plashing in the
midst.&nbsp; I said that here was that union of the sylvan and
the urban which was always the dream of art, and which formed the
delicate charm of pastoral poetry; and although I do not think
she quite grasped the notion, I saw that she had a pleasure in
the visible fact, and that was much better.&nbsp; Besides, she
listened very respectfully, and with no signs of being bored.</p>
<p>In the wait between the two parts of the concert I invited her
to walk around the court with me, and under the approving eye of
Mrs. March we made this expedition.&nbsp; It seemed to me that I
could not do a wiser thing, both for the satisfaction of my own
curiosity and for the gratification of the autobiographical
passion we all feel, than to lead her on to speak of
herself.&nbsp; But she had little or nothing to say of herself,
and what she said of other things was marked by a straightforward
good sense, if not a wide intelligence.&nbsp; I think we make a
mistake when we suppose that a beautiful woman must always be
vain or conscious.</p>
<p>I fancy that a beauty is quite as often a solid and sensible
person, with no inordinate wish to be worshipped, and this young
lady struck me as wholly unspoiled by flattery.&nbsp; I decided
that she was not the type that would take the fancy of De Witt
Point, and that she had grown up without local attention for that
reason, or possibly because a certain coldness in her overawed
the free spirit of rustic love-making.&nbsp; No doubt she knew
that she was beautiful, and I began to think that it was not so
much disappointment at finding Saratoga as indifferent as De Witt
Point which gave her the effect of disgust I had first noted in
her the night before.&nbsp; That might rather have come from the
sense of feeling herself a helpless burden on her friends, and
from that young longing for companionship which is as far as may
be from the desire of conquest, of triumph.&nbsp; Finding her now
so gratefully content with the poor efforts to amuse her which an
old fellow like me could make, I perceived that the society of
other girls would suffice to make Saratoga quite another thing
for her, and I cast about in my mind to contrive this
somehow.</p>
<p>I confess that I liked her better and better, and before the
evening was out I had quite transferred my compassion from the
Deerings to her.&nbsp; It <i>was</i> forlorn and dreary for her
to be attached to this good couple, whose interests were
primarily in each other, and who had not the first of those arts
which could provide her with other company.&nbsp; She willingly
told about their journey to Saratoga, and her story did not
differ materially from the account Deering had already given me;
but even the outward form of adventure had fallen from their
experience since they had come to Saratoga.&nbsp; They had formed
the habit of Congress Park by accident; but they had not been to
the lake, or the races, or the House of Pansa, or Mount
M&rsquo;Gregor, or Hilton Park, or even the outlying
springs.&nbsp; It was the first time they had been inside of the
Grand Union.&nbsp; &ldquo;Then you have never seen the
parlour?&rdquo; I asked; and after the concert I boldly led the
way into the parlour, and lavished its magnificence upon them as
if I had been the host, or one of the hotel guests at the very
least.&nbsp; I enjoyed the breathlessness of the Deerings so
much, as we walked up and down the vast drawing-rooms accompanied
by our images in the mirrors, that I insisted upon sitting down
with them all upon some of the richest pieces of furniture; and I
was so flown with my success as cicerone that I made them come
with me to the United States.&nbsp; I showed them through the
parlours there, and then led them through to the inner verandah,
which commanded another wooded court like that of the Grand
Union.&nbsp; I tried to make them feel the statelier sentiment of
the older hotel, and to stir their imaginations with a picture of
the old times, when the Southern planters used to throng the
place, and all that was gay and brilliant in fashionable society
was to be seen there some time during the summer.&nbsp; I think
that I failed in this, but apparently I succeeded in giving them
an evening of dazzling splendour.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, sir, this has been a great treat,&rdquo; said Mr.
Deering, when he bade us goodbye as well as good-night; he was
going early in the morning.</p>
<p>The ladies murmured their gratitude, Mrs. Deering with an
emotion that suited her thanks, and Miss Gage with a touch of
something daughterly toward me that I thought pretty.</p>
<h2><a name="page62"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
62</span>VI</h2>
<p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Well</span>, what <i>did</i> you
make of her, my dear?&rdquo; Mrs. March demanded the instant she
was beyond their hearing.&nbsp; &ldquo;I must say, you
didn&rsquo;t spare yourself in the cause; you did bravely.&nbsp;
What is she like?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Really, I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; I answered, after a
moment&rsquo;s reflection.&nbsp; &ldquo;I should say she was
almost purely potential.&nbsp; She&rsquo;s not so much this or
that kind of girl; she&rsquo;s merely a radiant image of
girlhood.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, your chicquing it, you&rsquo;re faking it,&rdquo;
said Mrs. March, borrowing the verbs severally from the art
editor and the publisher of <i>Every Other Week</i>.&nbsp;
&ldquo;You have got to tell me just how much and how little there
really is of her before I go any further with them.&nbsp; Is she
stupid?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No&mdash;no; I shouldn&rsquo;t say stupid
exactly.&nbsp; She is&mdash;what shall I say?&mdash;extremely
plain-minded.&nbsp; I suppose the goddesses were
plain-minded.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m a little puzzled by her attitude
toward her own beauty.&nbsp; She doesn&rsquo;t live her beauty
any more than a poet lives his poetry or a painter his painting;
though I&rsquo;ve no doubt she knows her gift is hers just as
they do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think I understand.&nbsp; You mean she isn&rsquo;t
conscious.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No.&nbsp; Conscious isn&rsquo;t quite the word,&rdquo;
I said fastidiously.&nbsp; &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t there some word
that says less, or more, in the same direction?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, there isn&rsquo;t; and I shall think you
don&rsquo;t mean anything at all if you keep on.&nbsp; Now, tell
me how she really impressed you.&nbsp; Does she know
anything?&nbsp; Has she read anything?&nbsp; Has she any
ideas?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Really, I can&rsquo;t say whether they were ideas or
not.&nbsp; She knew what <i>Every Other Week</i> was; she had
read the stories in it; but I&rsquo;m not sure she valued it at
its true worth.&nbsp; She is very plain-minded.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t keep repeating that!&nbsp; What do you mean
by plain-minded?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, honest, single, common-sense, coherent,
arithmetical.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Horrors!&nbsp; Do you mean that she is
<i>mannish</i>?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, not mannish.&nbsp; And yet she gave me the notion
that, when it came to companionship, she would be just as well
satisfied with a lot of girls as young men.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. March pulled her hand out of my arm, and stopped short
under one of those tall Saratoga shade-trees to dramatise her
inference.&nbsp; &ldquo;Then she is the slyest of all possible
pusses!&nbsp; Did she give you the notion that she would be just
as well satisfied with you as with a young man!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She couldn&rsquo;t deceive me so far as <i>that</i>, my
dear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well; I shall take her in hand myself to-morrow,
and find out what she really is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. March went shopping the next forenoon with what was left
of the Deering party; Deering had taken the early train north,
and she seemed to have found the ladies livelier without
him.&nbsp; She formed the impression from their more joyous
behaviour that he kept his wife from spending as much money as
she would naturally have done, and that, while he was not perhaps
exactly selfish, he was forgetful of her youth, of the difference
in years between them, and of her capacity for pleasures which he
could not care for.&nbsp; She said that Mrs. Deering and Miss
Gage now acted like two girls together, and, if anything, Miss
Gage seemed the elder of the two.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what did you decide about her?&rdquo; I
inquired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I helped her buy a hat and a jacket at one of
those nice shops just below the hotel where they&rsquo;re
stopping, and we&rsquo;ve started an evening dress for her.&nbsp;
She can&rsquo;t wear that white duck morning, noon, and
night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But her character&mdash;her nature?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&nbsp; Well, she is rather plain-minded, as you call
it.&nbsp; I think she shows out her real feelings too much for a
woman.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why do you prefer dissimulation in your sex, my
dear?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t call it dissimulation.&nbsp; But of
course a girl ought to hide her feelings.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t you
think it would have been better for her not to have looked so
obviously out of humour when you first saw her the other
night?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She wouldn&rsquo;t have interested me so much, then,
and she probably wouldn&rsquo;t have had your acquaintance
now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t mean to say that even that kind of
girl won&rsquo;t get on, if she gives her mind to it; but I think
I should prefer a little less plain-mindedness, as you call it,
if I were a man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I did not know exactly what to say to this, and I let Mrs.
March go on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s so in the smallest thing.&nbsp; If
you&rsquo;re choosing a thing for her, and she likes another, she
lets you feel it at once.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t mean that
she&rsquo;s rude about it, but she seems to set herself so square
across the way, and you come up with a kind of bump against
her.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s very feminine.&nbsp;
That&rsquo;s what I mean by mannish.&nbsp; You always know where
to find her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know why this criticism should have amused me so
much, but I began to laugh quite uncontrollably, and I laughed on
and on.&nbsp; Mrs. March kept her temper with me admirably.&nbsp;
When I was quiet again, she said&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Deering is a person that wins your heart at once;
she has that appealing quality.&nbsp; You can see that
she&rsquo;s cowed by her husband, though he means to be kind to
her; and yet you may be sure she gets round him, and has her own
way all the time.&nbsp; I know it was her idea to have him go
home and leave them here, and of course she made him think it was
his.&nbsp; She saw that as long as he was here, and anxious to
get back to his &lsquo;stock,&rsquo; there was no hope of giving
Miss Gage the sort of chance she came for, and so she determined
to manage it.&nbsp; At the same time, you can see that she is
true as steel, and would abhor anything like deceit worse than
the pest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see; and that is why you dislike Miss
Gage?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dislike her?&nbsp; No, I don&rsquo;t dislike her; but
she is disappointing.&nbsp; If she were a plain girl her
plain-mindedness would be all right; it would be amusing; she
would turn it to account and make it seem humorous.&nbsp; But it
doesn&rsquo;t seem to go with her beauty; it takes away from
that&mdash;I don&rsquo;t know how to express it
exactly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean that she has no charm.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No; I don&rsquo;t mean that at all.&nbsp; She has a
great deal of charm of a certain kind, but it&rsquo;s a very
peculiar kind.&nbsp; After all, the truth is the truth, Basil,
isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is sometimes, my dear,&rdquo; I assented.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the truth has its charm, even when it&rsquo;s too
blunt.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, I&rsquo;m not so sure of that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes&mdash;yes, it has.&nbsp; You mustn&rsquo;t say so,
Basil, or I shall lose all my faith in you.&nbsp; If I
couldn&rsquo;t trust you, I don&rsquo;t know what I should
do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are you after now, Isabel?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am not after anything.&nbsp; I want you to go round
to all the hotels and see if there is not some young man you know
at one of them.&nbsp; There surely must be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Would one young man be enough?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If he were attentive enough, he would be.&nbsp; One
young man is as good as a thousand if the girl is the right
kind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you have just been implying that Miss Gage is cold
and selfish and greedy.&nbsp; Shall I go round exploring hotel
registers for a victim to such a divinity as that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No; you needn&rsquo;t go till I have had a talk with
her.&nbsp; I am not sure she is worth it; I am not sure that I
want to do a single thing for her.&rdquo;</p>
<h2><a name="page69"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
69</span>VII</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> next day, after another
forenoon&rsquo;s shopping with her friends, Mrs. March announced:
&ldquo;Well, now, it has all come out, Basil, and I wonder you
didn&rsquo;t get the secret at once from your Mr. Deering.&nbsp;
Have you been supposing that Miss Gage was a poor girl whom the
Deerings had done the favour of bringing with them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, what of it?&rdquo; I asked provisionally.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She is very well off.&nbsp; Her father is not only the
president, as they call it, of the village, but he&rsquo;s the
president of the bank.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; I told you that Deering told me
so&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But he is very queer.&nbsp; He has kept her very close
from the other young people, and Mrs. Deering is the only girl
friend she&rsquo;s ever had, and she&rsquo;s grown up without
having been anywhere without him.&nbsp; They had to plead with
him to let her come with them&mdash;or Mrs. Deering
had,&mdash;but when he once consented, he consented
handsomely.&nbsp; He gave her a lot of money, and told them he
wanted her to have the best time that money could buy; and of
course you can understand how such a man would think that money
would buy a good time anywhere.&nbsp; But the Deerings
didn&rsquo;t know how to go about it.&nbsp; She confessed as much
when we were talking the girl over.&nbsp; I could see that she
stood in awe of her somehow from the beginning, and that she felt
more than the usual responsibility for her.&nbsp; That was the
reason she was so eager to get her husband off home; as long as
he was with them she would have to work everything through him,
and that would be double labour, because he is so hopelessly
<i>villaginous</i>, don&rsquo;t you know, that he never could
rise to the conception of anything else.&nbsp; He took them to a
cheap, second-class hotel, and he was afraid to go with them
anywhere because he never was sure that it was the right thing to
do; and he was too proud to ask, and they had to keep prodding
him all the time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s delightful!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I dare say you think so; but if you knew how it
wounded a woman&rsquo;s self-respect you would feel differently;
or you wouldn&rsquo;t, rather.&nbsp; But now, thank goodness;
they&rsquo;ve got him off their hands, and they can begin to
breathe freely.&nbsp; That is, Mrs. Deering could, if she
hadn&rsquo;t her heart in her mouth all the time, wondering what
she can do for the girl, and bullying herself with the notion
that she is to blame if she doesn&rsquo;t have a good time.&nbsp;
You can understand just how it was with them always.&nbsp; Mrs.
Deering is one of those meek little things that a great,
splendid, lonely creature like Miss Gage would take to in a small
place, and perfectly crush under the weight of her confidence;
and she would want to make her husband live up to her ideal of
the girl, and would be miserable because he wouldn&rsquo;t or
couldn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I believe the good Deering didn&rsquo;t even think her
handsome.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s it.&nbsp; And he thought anything that was
good enough for his wife was good enough for Miss Gage, and
he&rsquo;d be stubborn about doing things on her account, even to
please his wife.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Such conduct is imaginable of the good Deering.&nbsp; I
don&rsquo;t think he liked her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nor she him.&nbsp; Mrs. Deering helplessly hinted as
much.&nbsp; She said he didn&rsquo;t like to have her worrying so
much about Miss Gage&rsquo;s not having a good time, and she
couldn&rsquo;t make him feel as she did about it, and she was
half glad for his own sake that he had to go home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did she say that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not exactly; but you could see that she meant it.&nbsp;
Do you think it would do for them to change from their hotel, and
go to the Grand Union or the States or Congress Hall?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you been putting them up to that,
Isabel?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I knew you would suspect me, and I wouldn&rsquo;t have
asked for your opinion if I had cared anything for it,
really.&nbsp; What would be the harm of their doing
it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;None whatever, if you really want my worthless
opinion.&nbsp; But what could they do there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They could see something if they couldn&rsquo;t do
anything, and as soon as Miss Gage has got her new gowns
I&rsquo;m going to tell them you thought they could do it.&nbsp;
It was their own idea, at any rate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Miss Gage&rsquo;s?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Deering&rsquo;s.&nbsp; She has the courage of
a&mdash;I don&rsquo;t know what.&nbsp; She sees that it&rsquo;s a
desperate case, and she wouldn&rsquo;t stop at
anything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now that her husband has gone home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, which hotel shall they go to?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, that requires reflection.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well, then, when you&rsquo;ve reflected I want you
to go to the hotel you&rsquo;ve chosen, and introduce yourself to
the clerk, and tell him your wife has two friends coming, and you
want something very pleasant for them.&nbsp; Tell him all about
yourself and <i>Every Other Week</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;ll think I want them deadheaded.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No matter, if your conscience is clear; and don&rsquo;t
be so shamefully modest as you always are, but speak up
boldly.&nbsp; Now, will you?&nbsp; Promise me you
will!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will try, as the good little boy says.&nbsp; But,
Isabel, we don&rsquo;t know these people except from their own
account.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And that is quite enough.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It will be quite enough for the hotel-keeper if they
run their board.&nbsp; I shall have to pay it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, Basil dear, don&rsquo;t be disgusting, and go and
do as you&rsquo;re bid.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was amusing, but it was perfectly safe, and there was no
reason why I should not engage rooms for the ladies at another
hotel.&nbsp; I had not the least question of them, and I had
failed to worry my wife with a pretended doubt.&nbsp; So I
decided that I would go up at once and inquire at the Grand
Union.&nbsp; I chose this hotel because, though it lacked the
fine flower of the more ancient respectability and the legendary
charm of the States, it was so spectacular that it would be in
itself a perpetual excitement for those ladies, and would form an
effect of society which, with some help from us, might very well
deceive them.&nbsp; This was what I said to myself, though in my
heart I knew better.&nbsp; Whatever Mrs. Deering might think,
that girl was not going to be taken in with any such simple
device, and I must count upon the daily chances in the place to
afford her the good time she had come for.</p>
<p>As I mounted the steps to the portico of the Grand Union with
my head down, and lost in a calculation of these chances, I heard
my name gaily called, and I looked up to see young Kendricks,
formerly of our staff on <i>Every Other Week</i>, and still a
frequent contributor, and a great favourite of my wife&rsquo;s
and my own.&nbsp; My heart gave a great joyful bound at sight of
him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear boy, when in the world did you come?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This morning by the steamboat train, and I am never,
never going away!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You like it, then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Like it!&nbsp; It&rsquo;s the most delightful thing in
the universe.&nbsp; Why, I&rsquo;m simply wild about it, Mr.
March.&nbsp; I go round saying to myself, Why have I thrown away
my life?&nbsp; Why have I never come to Saratoga before?&nbsp;
It&rsquo;s simply supreme, and it&rsquo;s American down to the
ground.&nbsp; Yes; that&rsquo;s what makes it so
delightful.&nbsp; No other people could have invented it, and it
doesn&rsquo;t try to be anything but what we made it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m so glad you look at it in that way.&nbsp;
<i>We</i> like it.&nbsp; We discovered it three or four years
ago, and we never let a summer slip, if we can help it, without
coming here for a week or a month.&nbsp; The place,&rdquo; I
enlarged, &ldquo;has the charm of ruin, though it&rsquo;s in such
obvious repair; it has a past; it&rsquo;s so completely gone by
in a society sense.&nbsp; The cottage life here hasn&rsquo;t
killed the hotel life, as it has at Newport and Bar Harbour; but
the ideal of cottage life everywhere else has made hotel life at
Saratoga ungenteel.&nbsp; The hotels are full, but at the same
time they are society solitudes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How gay it is!&rdquo; said the young fellow, as he
gazed with a pensive smile into the street, where all those
festive vehicles were coming and going, dappled by the
leaf-shadows from the tall trees overhead.&nbsp; &ldquo;What air!
what a sky!&rdquo;&nbsp; The one was indeed sparkling, and the
other without a cloud, for it had rained in the night, and it
seemed as if the weather could never be hot and close again.</p>
<p>I forgot how I had been sweltering about, and said:
&ldquo;Yes; it is a Saratoga day.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s supposed that
the sparkle of the air comes from the healthful gases thrown off
by the springs.&nbsp; Some people say the springs are doctored;
that&rsquo;s what makes their gases so healthful.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, anything might happen here,&rdquo; Kendricks
mused, unheedful of me.&nbsp; &ldquo;What a scene! what a
stage!&nbsp; Why has nobody done a story about Saratoga?&rdquo;
he asked, with a literary turn I knew his thoughts would be
taking.&nbsp; All Gerald Kendricks&rsquo;s thoughts were of
literature, but sometimes they were not of immediate literary
effect, though that was never for long.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because,&rdquo; I suggested, &ldquo;one probably
couldn&rsquo;t get his young lady characters to come here if they
were at all in society.&nbsp; But of course there must be
charming presences here accidentally.&nbsp; Some young girl, say,
might come here from a country place, expecting to see social
gaiety&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, but that would be too heart-breaking!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not at all.&nbsp; Not if she met some young fellow
accidentally&mdash;don&rsquo;t you see?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It would be difficult to manage; and hasn&rsquo;t it
been done?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Everything has been done, my dear fellow.&nbsp; Or, you
might suppose a young lady who comes on here with her father, a
veteran politician, delegate to the Republican or Democratic
convention&mdash;all the conventions meet in Saratoga,&mdash;and
some ardent young delegate falls in love with her.&nbsp; That
would be new ground.&nbsp; There you would have the political
novel, which they wonder every now and then some of us
don&rsquo;t write.&rdquo;&nbsp; The smile faded from
Kendricks&rsquo;s lips, and I laughed.&nbsp; &ldquo;Well, then,
there&rsquo;s nothing for it but the Social Science
Congress.&nbsp; Have a brilliant professor win the heart of a
lovely sister-in-law of another member by a paper he reads before
the Congress.&nbsp; No?&nbsp; You&rsquo;re difficult.&nbsp; Are
you stopping here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; are you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I try to give myself the air of it when I am feeling
very proud.&nbsp; But really, we live at a most charming little
hotel on a back street, out of the whirl and rush that we should
prefer to be in if we could afford it.&rdquo;&nbsp; He said it
must be delightful, and he made the proper inquiries about Mrs.
March.&nbsp; Kendricks never forgot the gentleman in the artist,
and he was as true to the <i>convenances</i> as if they had been
principles.&nbsp; That was what made Mrs. March like his stories
so much more than the stories of some people who wrote
better.&nbsp; He said he would drop in during the afternoon, and
I went indoors on the pretext of buying a newspaper.&nbsp; Then,
without engaging rooms for Mrs. Deering and Miss Gage, I hurried
home.</p>
<h2><a name="page79"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
79</span>VIII</h2>
<p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Well</span>, did you get the
rooms?&rdquo; asked my wife as soon as she saw me.</p>
<p>She did not quite call it across the street to me as I came up
from where she sat on the piazza.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I didn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; I said boldly, if somewhat
breathlessly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t you?&nbsp; You ought to have gone to
the States if they were full at the Grand Union.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They were not full, unless Kendricks got their last
room.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you mean that <i>he</i> was there?&nbsp; Mr.
Kendricks?&nbsp; If you are hoaxing me, Basil!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am not, my dear; indeed I&rsquo;m not,&rdquo; said I,
beginning to laugh, and this made her doubt me the more.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because if you are I shall simply never forgive
you.&nbsp; And I&rsquo;m in earnest this time,&rdquo; she
replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why should I want to hoax you about such a vital thing
as that.&nbsp; Couldn&rsquo;t Kendricks come to Saratoga as well
as we?&nbsp; He&rsquo;s here looking up the ground of a story I
should think from what he said.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No matter what he&rsquo;s here for; he&rsquo;s here,
and that&rsquo;s enough.&nbsp; I never knew of anything so
perfectly providential.&nbsp; Did you <i>tell</i> him,
Basil?&nbsp; Did you dare?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell him what?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know; about Miss Gage.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I came very near it.&nbsp; I dangled the fact
before his eyes once, but I caught it away again in time.&nbsp;
He never saw it.&nbsp; I thought I&rsquo;d better let you tell
him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is he coming here to see us?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He asked if he might.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s always nice.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t know that I
shall ask him to do anything for them, after all; I&rsquo;m not
sure that she&rsquo;s worth it.&nbsp; I wish some commoner person
had happened along.&nbsp; Kendricks is too precious.&nbsp; I
shall have to think about it; and don&rsquo;t you tease me,
Basil, will you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know.&nbsp; If I&rsquo;m not allowed to
have any voice in the matter, I&rsquo;m afraid I shall take it
out in teasing.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t see why Miss Gage isn&rsquo;t
quite as good as Kendricks.&nbsp; I believe she&rsquo;s taller,
and though he&rsquo;s pretty good-looking, I prefer her style of
beauty.&nbsp; I dare say his family is better, but I fancy
she&rsquo;s richer; and his family isn&rsquo;t good beyond New
York city, and her money will go anywhere.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s a
pretty even thing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good gracious, Basil! you talk as if it were a question
of marriage.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you <i>think</i> it is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now I see that you&rsquo;re bent upon teasing, and we
won&rsquo;t talk any more, please.&nbsp; What time did he say he
would call?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I mayn&rsquo;t talk, I can&rsquo;t tell.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You may talk that much.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, then, he didn&rsquo;t say.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Basil,&rdquo; said my wife, after a moment, &ldquo;if
you could be serious, I should like very much to talk with
you.&nbsp; I know that you&rsquo;re excited by meeting Mr.
Kendricks, and I know what you thought the instant you saw
him.&nbsp; But, indeed, it won&rsquo;t do, my dear.&nbsp;
It&rsquo;s more than we&rsquo;ve any right to ask, and I shall
not ask it, and I shall not let you.&nbsp; She is a stiff,
awkward village person, and I don&rsquo;t believe she&rsquo;s
amiable or intelligent; and to let a graceful, refined, superior
man like Mr. Kendricks throw away his time upon her would be
wicked, simply wicked.&nbsp; Let those people manage for
themselves from this out.&nbsp; Of course you mustn&rsquo;t get
them rooms at the Grand Union now, for he&rsquo;d be seeing us
there with them, and feel bound to pay her attention.&nbsp; You
must try for them at the States, since the matter&rsquo;s been
spoken of, or at Congress Hall.&nbsp; But there&rsquo;s no
hurry.&nbsp; We must have time to think whether we shall use Mr.
Kendricks with them.&nbsp; I suppose it will do no harm to
introduce him.&nbsp; If he stays we can&rsquo;t very well avoid
it; and I confess I should like to see how she impresses
him!&nbsp; Of course we shall introduce him!&nbsp; But I insist I
shall just do it merely as one human being to another; and
don&rsquo;t you come in with any of your romantic nonsense,
Basil, about her social disappointment.&nbsp; Just how much did
you give the situation away?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I told as well as I could remember.&nbsp; &ldquo;Well,
that&rsquo;s nothing.&nbsp; He&rsquo;ll never think of it, and
you mustn&rsquo;t hint anything of the kind again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I promised devoutly, and she went on&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It wouldn&rsquo;t be nice&mdash;it wouldn&rsquo;t be
delicate to let him into the conspiracy.&nbsp; That must be
entirely our affair, don&rsquo;t you see?&nbsp; And I don&rsquo;t
want you to take a single step without me.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t
want you even to discuss her with him.&nbsp; Will you?&nbsp;
Because that will tempt you further.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That afternoon Kendricks came promptly to call, like the
little gentleman he was, and he was more satisfactory about
Saratoga than he had been in the morning even.&nbsp; Mrs. March
catechised him, and she didn&rsquo;t leave an emotion of his
unsearched by her vivid sympathy.&nbsp; She ended by
saying&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must write a story about Saratoga.&nbsp; And I have
got just the heroine for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I started, but she ignored my start.</p>
<p>Kendricks laughed, delighted, and asked, &ldquo;Is she
pretty?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Must a heroine be pretty?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She had better be.&nbsp; Otherwise she will have to be
tremendously clever and say all sorts of brilliant things, and
that puts a great burden on the author.&nbsp; If you proclaim
boldly at the start that she&rsquo;s a beauty, the illustrator
has got to look after her, and the author has a comparative
sinecure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. March thought a moment, and then she said: &ldquo;Well,
she is a beauty.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t want to make it too hard for
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When shall I see her?&rdquo; Kendricks demanded, and he
feigned an amusing anxiety.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, that depends upon how you behave, Mr.
Kendricks.&nbsp; If you are very, very good, perhaps I may let
you see her this evening.&nbsp; We will take you to call upon
her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is it possible?&nbsp; Do you mean business?&nbsp; Then
she is&mdash;in society?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Mr.</i> Kendricks!&rdquo; cried Mrs. March, with
burlesque severity.&nbsp; &ldquo;Do you think that I would offer
you a heroine who was <i>not</i> in society?&nbsp; You forget
that I am from Boston!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course, of course!&nbsp; I understand that any
heroine of your acquaintance must be in society.&nbsp; But I
thought&mdash;I didn&rsquo;t know&mdash;but for the
moment&mdash;Saratoga seems to be so tremendously mixed; and Mr.
March says there is no society here: But if she is from
Boston&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t say she was from Boston, Mr.
Kendricks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I beg your pardon!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She is from De Witt Point,&rdquo; said Mrs. March, and
she apparently enjoyed his confusion, no less than my
bewilderment at the course she was taking.</p>
<p>I was not going to be left behind, though, and I said:
&ldquo;I discovered this heroine myself, Kendricks, and if there
is to be any giving away&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, Basil!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am going to do it.&nbsp; Mrs. March would never have
cared anything about her if it hadn&rsquo;t been for me.&nbsp; I
can&rsquo;t let her impose on you.&nbsp; This heroine is no more
in society than she is from Boston.&nbsp; That is the trouble
with her.&nbsp; She has come here for society, and she
can&rsquo;t find any.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, that was what you were hinting at this
morning,&rdquo; said Kendricks.&nbsp; &ldquo;I thought it a pure
figment of the imagination.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;One doesn&rsquo;t imagine such things as that, my dear
fellow.&nbsp; One imagines a heroine coming here, and having the
most magnificent kind of social career&mdash;lawn-parties,
lunches, teas, dinners, picnics, hops&mdash;and going back to De
Witt Point with a dozen offers of marriage.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s
the kind of work the imagination does.&nbsp; But this simple and
appealing situation&mdash;this beautiful young girl, with her
poor little illusions, her secret hopes half hidden from herself,
her ignorant past, her visionary future&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, <i>I</i> am going to tell you all about her, Mr.
Kendricks,&rdquo; Mrs. March broke in upon me, with defiance in
her eye; and she flung out the whole fact with a rapidity of
utterance that would have left far behind any attempt of
mine.&nbsp; But I made no attempt to compete with her; I
contented myself with a sarcastic silence which I could see
daunted her a little at last.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And all that we&rsquo;ve done, my dear
fellow&rdquo;&mdash;I took in irony the word she left to
me&mdash;&ldquo;is to load ourselves up with these two impossible
people, to go their security to destiny, and answer for their
having a good time.&nbsp; We&rsquo;re in luck.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; said Kendricks, and I
could see that his fancy was beginning to play with the
situation; &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see why it isn&rsquo;t a charming
scheme.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course it is,&rdquo; cried Mrs. March, taking a
little heart from his courage.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We can&rsquo;t make out yet whether the girl is
interesting,&rdquo; I put in maliciously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is what <i>you</i> say,&rdquo; said my wife.&nbsp;
&ldquo;She is very shy, and of course she wouldn&rsquo;t show out
her real nature to you.&nbsp; I found her <i>very</i>
interesting.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, Isabel!&rdquo; I protested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She is fascinating,&rdquo; the perverse woman
persisted.&nbsp; &ldquo;She has a fascinating dulness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kendricks laughed and I jeered at this complex
characterisation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You make me impatient to judge for myself,&rdquo; he
said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will you go with me to call upon them this
evening?&rdquo; asked Mrs. March.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall be delighted.&nbsp; And you can count upon me
to aid and abet you in your generous conspiracy, Mrs. March, to
the best of my ability.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s nothing I should like
better than to help you&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Throw &lsquo;dust in her beautiful eyes,&rsquo;&rdquo;
I quoted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not at all,&rdquo; said my wife.&nbsp; &ldquo;But to
spread a beatific haze over everything, so that as long as she
stays in Saratoga she shall see life rose-colour.&nbsp; Of course
you may say that it&rsquo;s a kind of deception&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not at all!&rdquo; cried the young fellow in his
turn.&nbsp; &ldquo;We will make it reality.&nbsp; Then there will
be no harm in it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What a jesuitical casuist!&nbsp; You had better read
what Cardinal Newman says in his <i>Apologia</i> about lying,
young man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Neither of them minded me, for just then there was a stir of
drapery round the corner of the piazza from where we were
sitting, and the next moment Mrs. Deering and Miss Gage showed
themselves.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We were just talking of you,&rdquo; said Mrs.
March.&nbsp; &ldquo;May I present our friend Mr. Kendricks, Mrs.
Deering?&nbsp; And Miss Gage?&rdquo;</p>
<p>At sight of the young man, so well dressed and good-looking,
who bowed so prettily to her, and then bustled to place chairs
for them, a certain cloud seemed to lift from Miss Gage&rsquo;s
beautiful face, and to be at least partly broken on Mrs.
Deering&rsquo;s visage.&nbsp; I began to talk to the girl, and
she answered in good spirits, and with more apparent interest in
my conversation than she had yet shown, while Kendricks very
properly devoted himself to the other ladies.&nbsp; Both his eyes
were on them, but I felt that he had a third somehow upon her,
and that the smallest fact of her beauty and grace was not lost
upon him.&nbsp; I knew that her rich, tender voice was doing its
work, too, through the commonplaces she vouchsafed to me.&nbsp;
There was a moment when I saw him lift a questioning eyebrow upon
Mrs. March, and saw her answer with a fleeting frown of
affirmation.&nbsp; I cannot tell just how it was that, before he
left us, his chair was on the other side of Miss Gage&rsquo;s,
and I was eliminated from the dialogue.</p>
<p>He did not stay too long.&nbsp; There was another tableau of
him on foot, taking leave of Mrs. March, with a high hand-shake,
which had then lately come in, and which I saw the girl note, and
then bowing to her and to Mrs. Deering.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t forget,&rdquo; my wife called after him,
with a ready invention not lost on his quick intelligence,
&ldquo;that you&rsquo;re going to the concert with us after
tea.&nbsp; Eight o&rsquo;clock, remember.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You may be sure I shall remember <i>that</i>,&rdquo; he
returned gaily.</p>
<h2><a name="page90"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
90</span>IX</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> countenances of the ladies fell
instantly when he was gone.&nbsp; &ldquo;Mrs. March,&rdquo; said
Mrs. Deering, with a nervous tremor, &ldquo;did Mr. March get us
those rooms at the Grand Union?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No&mdash;no,&rdquo; my wife began, and she made a
little pause, as if to gather plausibility.&nbsp; &ldquo;The
Grand Union was very full, and he thought that at the
States&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because,&rdquo; said Mrs. Deering, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t
know as we shall trouble him, after all.&nbsp; Mr. Deering
isn&rsquo;t very well, and I guess we have got to go
home&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Go home</i>!&rdquo; Mrs. March echoed, and her voice
was a tone-scene of a toppling hope and a widespread
desolation.&nbsp; &ldquo;Why, you mustn&rsquo;t!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We must, I guess.&nbsp; It had begun to be very
pleasant, and&mdash;I guess I have got to go.&nbsp; I can&rsquo;t
feel easy about him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, of course,&rdquo; Mrs. March now assented, and she
waved her fan thoughtfully before her face.&nbsp; I knew what she
was thinking of, and I looked at Miss Gage, who had involuntarily
taken the pose and expression of the moment when I first saw her
at the kiosk in Congress Park.&nbsp; &ldquo;And Miss
Gage?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh yes; I must go too,&rdquo; said the girl wistfully,
forlornly.&nbsp; She had tears in her voice, tears of despair and
vexation, I should have said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s too bad,&rdquo; said Mrs. March, and, as
she did not offer any solution of the matter, I thought it rather
heartless of her to go on and rub it in.&nbsp; &ldquo;And we were
just planning some things we could do together.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It can&rsquo;t be helped now,&rdquo; returned the
girl.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But we shall see you again before you go?&rdquo; Mrs.
March asked of both.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; said the girl, with a
look at Mrs. Deering, who now said&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess so.&nbsp; We&rsquo;ll let you know when
we&rsquo;re going.&rdquo;&nbsp; And they got away rather
stiffly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why in the world, my dear,&rdquo; I asked, &ldquo;if
you weren&rsquo;t going to promote their stay, need you prolong
the agony of their acquaintance?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you feel that about it too?&nbsp; Well, I wanted to
ask you first if you thought it would do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know; get her a room here.&nbsp; Because if we do
we shall have her literally on our hands as long as we are
here.&nbsp; We shall have to have the whole care and
responsibility of her, and I wanted you to feel just what you
were going in for.&nbsp; You know very well I can&rsquo;t do
things by halves, and that if I undertake to chaperon this girl I
shall chaperon her&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To the bitter end.&nbsp; Yes; I understand the
conditions of your uncompromising conscience.&nbsp; But I
don&rsquo;t believe it will be any such killing matter.&nbsp;
There are other semi-detached girls in the house; she could go
round with them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We talked on, and, as sometimes happens, we convinced each
other so thoroughly that she came to my ground and I went to
hers.&nbsp; Then it was easier for us to come together, and after
making me go to the clerk and find out that he had a vacant room,
Mrs. March agreed with me that it would not do at all to have
Miss Gage stay with us; the fact that there was a vacant room
seemed to settle the question.</p>
<p>We were still congratulating ourselves on our escape when Mrs.
Deering suddenly reappeared round our corner of the
verandah.&nbsp; She was alone, and she looked excited.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, it isn&rsquo;t anything,&rdquo; she said in answer
to the alarm that showed itself in Mrs. March&rsquo;s face at
sight of her.&nbsp; &ldquo;I hope you won&rsquo;t think
it&rsquo;s too presuming, Mrs. March, and I want you to believe
that it&rsquo;s something I have thought of by myself, and that
Julia wouldn&rsquo;t have let me come if she had dreamed of such
a thing.&nbsp; I do hate so to take her back with me, now that
she&rsquo;s begun to have a good time, and I was
wondering&mdash;wondering whether it would be asking too much if
I tried to get her a room here.&nbsp; I shouldn&rsquo;t exactly
like to leave her in the hotel alone, though I suppose it would
be perfectly proper; but Mr. Deering found out when he was trying
to get rooms before that there were some young ladies staying by
themselves here, and I didn&rsquo;t want to ask the clerk for a
room unless you felt just right about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, of course, Mrs. Deering.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s a public
house, like any other, and you have as much
right&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I didn&rsquo;t want you to think that I would do it
without asking you, and if it is going to be the least bit of
trouble to you.&rdquo;&nbsp; The poor thing while she talked
stood leaning anxiously over toward Mrs. March, who had risen,
and pressing the points of her fingers nervously together.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It won&rsquo;t, Mrs. Deering.&nbsp; It will be nothing
but pleasure.&nbsp; Why, certainly.&nbsp; I shall be delighted to
have Miss Gage here, and anything that Mr. March and I can
do&mdash;Why, we had just been talking of it, and Mr. March has
this minute got back from seeing the clerk, and she can have a
very nice room.&nbsp; We had been intending to speak to you about
it as soon as we saw you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I do not know whether this was quite true or not, but I was
glad Mrs. March said it, from the effect it had upon Mrs.
Deering.&nbsp; Tears of relief came into her eyes, and she said:
&ldquo;Then I can go home in the morning.&nbsp; I was going to
stay on a day or two longer, on Julia&rsquo;s account, but I
didn&rsquo;t feel just right about Mr. Deering, and now I
won&rsquo;t have to.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There followed a flutter of polite offers and refusals,
acknowledgments and disavowals, and an understanding that I would
arrange it all, and that we would come to Mrs. Deering&rsquo;s
hotel after supper and see Miss Gage about the when and the how
of her coming to us.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Isabel,&rdquo; I said, after it was all over, and
Mrs. Deering had vanished in a mist of happy tears, &ldquo;I
suppose this is what you call perfectly providential.&nbsp; Do
you really believe that Miss Gage didn&rsquo;t send her
back?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know she didn&rsquo;t.&nbsp; But I know that she
<i>had</i> to do it just the same as if Miss Gage had driven her
at the point of the bayonet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I laughed at this tragical image.&nbsp; &ldquo;Can she be such
a terror?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She is an ideal.&nbsp; And Mrs. Deering is as afraid as
death of her.&nbsp; Of course she has to live up to her.&nbsp;
It&rsquo;s probably been the struggle of her life, and I can
quite imagine her letting her husband die before she would take
Miss Gage back, unless she went back satisfied.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe I can imagine so much as that
exactly, but I can imagine her being afraid of Miss Gage&rsquo;s
taking it out of her somehow.&nbsp; Now she will take it out of
us.&nbsp; I hope you realise that you&rsquo;ve done it now, my
dear.&nbsp; To be sure, you will have all your life to repent of
your rashness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall never repent,&rdquo; Mrs. March retorted
hardily.&nbsp; &ldquo;It was the right thing, the only
thing.&nbsp; We couldn&rsquo;t have let that poor creature stay
on, when she was so anxious to get back to her
husband.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I confess, Basil, that I feel a little pity for
that poor girl, too.&nbsp; It would have been cruel, it would
have been fairly wicked, to let her go home so soon, and
especially now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&nbsp; And I suppose that by <i>especially now</i>,
you mean Kendricks,&rdquo; I said, and I laughed mockingly, as
the novelists say.&nbsp; &ldquo;How sick I am of this stale old
love-business between young people!&nbsp; We ought to know
better&mdash;we&rsquo;re old enough; at least <i>you</i>
are.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She seemed not to feel the gibe.&nbsp; &ldquo;Why,
Basil,&rdquo; she asked dreamily, &ldquo;haven&rsquo;t you any
romance left in you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Romance?&nbsp; Bah!&nbsp; It&rsquo;s the most
ridiculous unreality in the world.&nbsp; If you had so much
sympathy for that stupid girl, in that poor woman in her anxiety
about her disappointment, why hadn&rsquo;t you a little for her
sick husband?&nbsp; But a husband is nothing&mdash;when you have
got him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I did sympathise with her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t say so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, she is only his second wife, and I don&rsquo;t
suppose it&rsquo;s anything serious.&nbsp; Didn&rsquo;t I really
say anything to her?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not a word.&nbsp; It is curious,&rdquo; I went on,
&ldquo;how we let this idiotic love-passion absorb us to the very
last.&nbsp; It is wholly unimportant who marries who, or whether
anybody marries at all.&nbsp; And yet we no sooner have the
making of a love-affair within reach than we revert to the folly
of our own youth, and abandon ourselves to it as if it were one
of the great interests of life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who is talking about love?&nbsp; It isn&rsquo;t a
question of that.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s a question of making a girl
have a pleasant time for a few days; and what is the harm of
it?&nbsp; Girls have a dull enough time at the very best.&nbsp;
My heart aches for them, and I shall never let a chance slip to
help them, I don&rsquo;t care what you say.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, Isabel,&rdquo; I returned, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t you
be a humbug.&nbsp; This is a perfectly plain case, and you are
going in for a very risky affair with your eyes open.&nbsp; You
shall not pretend you&rsquo;re not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well, then, if I am going into it with my eyes
open, I shall look out that nothing happens.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you think prevision will avail!&nbsp; I
wish,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;that instead of coming home that
night and telling you about this girl, I had confined my
sentimentalising to that young French-Canadian mother, and her
dirty little boy who ate the pea-nut shells.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve no
doubt it was really a more tragical case.&nbsp; They looked
dreadfully poor and squalid.&nbsp; Why couldn&rsquo;t I have
amused my idle fancy with their fortunes&mdash;the sort of
husband and father they had, their shabby home, the struggle of
their life?&nbsp; That is the appeal that a genuine person
listens to.&nbsp; Nothing does more to stamp me a <i>poseur</i>
than the fact that I preferred to bemoan myself for a sulky girl
who seemed not to be having a good time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was truth in my joking, but the truth did not save me;
it lost me rather.&nbsp; &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said my wife;
&ldquo;it was your fault.&nbsp; I should never have seen anything
in her if it had not been for you.&nbsp; It was your coming back
and working me up about her that began the whole thing, and now
if anything goes wrong you will have yourself to thank for
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She seized the opportunity of my having jestingly taken up
this load to buckle it on me tight and fast, clasping it here,
tying it there, and giving a final pull to the knots that left me
scarcely the power to draw my breath, much less the breath to
protest.&nbsp; I was forced to hear her say again that all her
concern from the beginning was for Mrs. Deering, and that now, if
she had offered to do something for Miss Gage, it was not because
she cared anything for her, but because she cared everything for
Mrs. Deering, who could never lift up her head again at De Witt
Point if she went back so completely defeated in all the purposes
she had in asking Miss Gage to come with her to Saratoga.</p>
<p>I did not observe that this wave of compassion carried Mrs.
March so far as to leave her stranded with Mrs. Deering that
evening when we called with Kendricks, and asked her and Miss
Gage to go with us to the Congress Park concert.&nbsp; Mrs.
Deering said that she had to pack, that she did not feel just
exactly like going; and my tender heart ached with a knowledge of
her distress.&nbsp; Miss Gage made a faint, false pretence of
refusing to come with us, too; but Mrs. Deering urged her to go,
and put on the new dress, which had just come home, so that Mrs.
March could see it.&nbsp; The girl came back looking radiant,
divine, and&mdash;&ldquo;Will it do?&rdquo; she palpitated under
my wife&rsquo;s critical glance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do?&nbsp; It will <i>out</i>do!&nbsp; I never saw
anything like it!&rdquo;&nbsp; The connoisseur patted it a little
this way and a little that.&nbsp; &ldquo;It is a dream!&nbsp; Did
the hat come too?&rdquo;</p>
<p>It appeared that the hat had come too.&nbsp; Miss Gage
rematerialised with it on, after a moment&rsquo;s evanescence,
and looked at my wife with the expression of being something
impersonal with a hat on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Simply, there is nothing to say!&rdquo; cried Mrs.
March.&nbsp; The girl put up her hands to it.&nbsp; &ldquo;Good
gracious!&nbsp; You mustn&rsquo;t take it off!&nbsp; Your costume
is perfect for the concert.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is it, really?&rdquo; asked the girl joyfully; and she
seemed to find this the first fitting moment to say, for sole
recognition of our self-sacrifice, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m much obliged
to you, Mr. March, for getting me that room.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I begged her not to speak of it, and turned an ironical eye
upon my wife; but she was lost in admiration of the hat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she sighed; &ldquo;it&rsquo;s much better
than the one I wanted you to get at first.&rdquo;&nbsp; And she
afterward explained that the girl seemed to have a perfect
instinct for what went with her style.</p>
<p>Kendricks kept himself discreetly in the background, and, with
his unfailing right feeling, was talking to Mrs. Deering, in
spite of her not paying much attention to him.&nbsp; I must own
that I too was absorbed in the spectacle of Miss Gage.</p>
<p>She went off with us, and did not say another word to Mrs.
Deering about helping her to pack.&nbsp; Perhaps this was best,
though it seemed heartless; it may not have been so heartless as
it seemed.&nbsp; I dare say it would have been more suffering to
the woman if the girl had missed this chance.</p>
<h2><a name="page102"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
102</span>X</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">We</span> had undertaken rather a queer
affair but it was not so queer after all, when Miss Gage was
fairly settled with us.&nbsp; There were other young girls in
that pleasant house who had only one another&rsquo;s protection
and the general safety of the social atmosphere.&nbsp; We could
not conceal from ourselves, of course, that we had done a rather
romantic thing, and, in the light of Europe, which we had more or
less upon our actions, rather an absurd thing; but it was a
comfort to find that Miss Gage thought it neither romantic nor
absurd.&nbsp; She took the affair with an apparent ignorance of
anything unusual in it&mdash;with so much ignorance, indeed, that
Mrs. March had her occasional question whether she was duly
impressed with what was being done for her.&nbsp; Whether this
was so or not, it is certain that she was as docile and as
biddable as need be.&nbsp; She did not always ask what she should
do; that would not have been in the tradition of village
independence; but she always did what she was told, and did not
vary from her instructions a hair&rsquo;s-breadth.&nbsp; I do not
suppose she always knew why she might do this and might not do
that; and I do not suppose that young girls often understand the
reasons of the proprieties.&nbsp; They are told that they must,
and that they must not, and this in an astonishing degree
suffices them if they are nice girls.</p>
<p>Of course there was pretty constant question of Kendricks in
the management of Miss Gage&rsquo;s amusement, for that was
really what our enterprise resolved itself into.&nbsp; He showed
from the first the sweetest disposition to forward all our plans
in regard to her, and, in fact, he even anticipated our
wishes.&nbsp; I do not mean to give the notion that he behaved
from an interested motive in going to the station the morning
Mrs. Deering left, and getting her ticket for her, and checking
her baggage, and posting her in the changes she would have to
make.&nbsp; This was something I ought to have thought of myself,
but I did not think of it, and I am willing that he should have
all the credit.</p>
<p>I know that he did it out of the lovely generosity of nature
which always took me in him.&nbsp; Miss Gage was there with her,
and she remained to be consoled after Mrs. Deering
departed.&nbsp; They came straight to us from the train, and
then, when he had consigned Miss Gage to Mrs. March&rsquo;s care,
he offered to go and see that her things were transferred from
her hotel to ours; they were all ready, she said, and the bill
was paid.</p>
<p>He did not come back that day, and, in fact, he delicately
waited for some sign from us that his help was wanted.&nbsp; But
when he did come he had formulated Saratoga very completely, and
had a better conception of doing it than I had, after my repeated
sojourns.</p>
<p>We went very early in our explorations to the House of Pansa,
which you find in very much better repair at Saratoga than you do
at Pompeii, and we contrived to pass a whole afternoon
there.&nbsp; My wife and I had been there before more than once;
but it always pleasantly recalled our wander-years, when we first
met in Europe, and we suffered round after those young things
with a patience which I hope will not be forgotten at the day of
judgment.&nbsp; When we came to a seat we sat down, and let them
go off by themselves; but my recollection is that there is not
much furniture in the House of Pansa that you can sit down on,
and for the most part we all kept together.</p>
<p>Kendricks and I thought alike about the Pompeian house as a
model of something that might be done in the way of a seaside
cottage in our own country, and we talked up a little paper that
might be done for <i>Every Other Week</i>, with pretty
architectural drawings, giving an account of our imaginary
realisation of the notion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have somebody,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;visit people who
had been boring him to come down, or up, or out, and see them,
and find them in a Pompeian house, with the sea in front and a
blue-green grove of low pines behind.&nbsp; Might have a thread
of story, but mostly talk about how they came to do it, and how
delightfully livable they found it.&nbsp; You could work it up
with some architect, who would help you to &lsquo;keep off the
grass&rsquo; in the way of technical blunders.&nbsp; With all
this tendency to the classic in public architecture, I
don&rsquo;t see why the Pompeian villa shouldn&rsquo;t be the
next word for summer cottages.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, we&rsquo;ll see what Fulkerson says.&nbsp; He may
see an ad. in it.&nbsp; Would you like to do it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why not do it yourself?&nbsp; Nobody else could do it
so well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thanks for the taffy; but the idea was
yours.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll do it,&rdquo; said Kendricks after a moment,
&ldquo;if you won&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll see.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Miss Gage stared, and Mrs. March said&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t suppose the House of Pansa would lead to
shop with you two.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You never can tell which way copy lies,&rdquo; I
returned; and I asked the girl, &ldquo;What should <i>you</i>
think, Miss Gage, of a little paper with a thread of story, but
mostly talk, on a supposititious Pompeian cottage?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe I understand,&rdquo; said she,
far too remote from our literary interests, as I saw, to be
ashamed of her ignorance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There!&rdquo; I said to Kendricks.&nbsp; &ldquo;Do you
think the general public would?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Miss Gage isn&rsquo;t the general public,&rdquo; said
my wife, who had followed the course of my thought; her tone
implied that Miss Gage was wiser and better.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Would you allow yourself to be drawn,&rdquo; I asked,
&ldquo;dreamily issuing from an aisle of the pine grove as the
tutelary goddess of a Pompeian cottage?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl cast a bewildered glance at my wife, who said,
&ldquo;You needn&rsquo;t pay any attention to him, Miss
Gage.&nbsp; He has an idea that he is making a joke.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We felt that we had done enough for one afternoon, when we had
done the House of Pansa, and I proposed that we should go and sit
down in Congress Park and listen to the Troy band.&nbsp; I was
not without the hope that it would play &ldquo;Washington
Post.&rdquo;</p>
<p>My wife contrived that we should fall in behind the young
people as we went, and she asked, &ldquo;What <i>do</i> you
suppose she made of it all?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Probably she thought it was the house of Sancho
Panza.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No; she hasn&rsquo;t read enough to be so ignorant even
as that.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s astonishing how much she doesn&rsquo;t
know.&nbsp; What can her home life have been like?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Philistine to the last degree.&nbsp; We people who are
near to literature have no conception how far from it most people
are.&nbsp; The immense majority of &lsquo;homes,&rsquo; as the
newspapers call them, have no books in them except the Bible and
a semi-religious volume or two&mdash;things you never see out of
such &lsquo;homes&rsquo;&mdash;and the State business
directory.&nbsp; I was astonished when it came out that she knew
about <i>Every Other Week</i>.&nbsp; It must have been by
accident.&nbsp; The sordidness of her home life must be something
unimaginable.&nbsp; The daughter of a village capitalist,
who&rsquo;s put together his money dollar by dollar, as they do
in such places, from the necessities and follies of his
neighbours, and has half the farmers of the region by the throat
through his mortgages&mdash;I don&rsquo;t think that she&rsquo;s
&lsquo;one to be desired&rsquo; any more than &lsquo;the daughter
of a hundred earls,&rsquo; if so much.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She doesn&rsquo;t seem sordid herself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, the taint doesn&rsquo;t show itself at
once&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;If nature put not forth her power<br />
About the opening of the flower,<br />
Who is it that would live an hour?&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and she <i>is</i> a flower, beautiful, exquisite.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, and she had a mother as well as this father of
hers.&nbsp; Why shouldn&rsquo;t she be like her
mother?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I laughed.&nbsp; &ldquo;That is true!&nbsp; I wonder why we
always leave the mother out of the count when we sum up the
hereditary tendencies?&nbsp; I suppose the mother is as much a
parent as the father.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quite.&nbsp; And there is no reason why this girl
shouldn&rsquo;t have her mother&rsquo;s nature.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t actually <i>know</i> anything against
her father&rsquo;s nature yet,&rdquo; I suggested; &ldquo;but if
her mother lived a starved and stunted life with him, it may
account for that effect of disappointed greed which I fancied in
her when I first saw her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t call it greed in a young girl to want to
see something of the world.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you call it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kendricks and the girl were stopping at the gate of the
pavilion, and looking round at us.&nbsp; &ldquo;Ah, he&rsquo;s
got enough for one day!&nbsp; He&rsquo;s going to leave her to us
now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When we came up he said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to run off a
moment; I&rsquo;m going up to the book-store there,&rdquo; and he
pointed toward one that had spread across the sidewalk just below
the Congress Hall verandah, with banks and shelves of novels, and
a cry of bargains in them on signs sticking up from their
rows.&nbsp; &ldquo;I want to see if they have the <i>Last Days of
Pompeii</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We will find the ladies inside the park,&rdquo; I
said.&nbsp; &ldquo;I will go with you&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. March wants to see if they have the last number of
<i>Every Other Week</i>,&rdquo; my wife mocked after us.&nbsp;
This was, indeed, commonly a foible of mine.&nbsp; I had newly
become one of the owners of the periodical as well as the editor,
and I was all the time looking out for it at the news-stands and
book-stores, and judging their enterprise by its presence or
absence.&nbsp; But this time I had another motive, though I did
not allege it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose it&rsquo;s for Miss Gage?&rdquo; I ventured
to say, by way of prefacing what I wished to say.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Kendricks, I&rsquo;m afraid we&rsquo;re abusing your good
nature.&nbsp; I know you&rsquo;re up here to look about, and
you&rsquo;re letting us use all your time.&nbsp; You
mustn&rsquo;t do it.&nbsp; Women have no conscience about these
things, and you can&rsquo;t expect a woman who has a young lady
on her hands to spare you.&nbsp; I give you the hint.&nbsp;
Don&rsquo;t count upon Mrs. March in this matter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I think you are very good to allow me to bother
round,&rdquo; said the young fellow, with that indefatigable
politeness of his.&nbsp; He added vaguely, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s very
interesting.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Seeing it through such a fresh mind?&rdquo; I
suggested.&nbsp; &ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ll own that I don&rsquo;t
think you could have found a much fresher one.&nbsp; Has she read
the <i>Last Days of Pompeii</i>?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She thought she had at first, but it was the <i>Fall of
Granada</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How delightful!&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t you wish we could
read books with that utterly unliterary sense of them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you think women generally do?&rdquo; he
asked evasively.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I daresay they do at De Witt Point.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He did not answer; I saw that he was not willing to talk the
young lady over, and I could not help praising his taste to
myself at the cost of my own.&nbsp; His delicacy forbade him the
indulgence which my own protested against in vain.&nbsp; He
showed his taste again in buying a cheap copy of the book, which
he meant to give her, and of course he had to be all the more
attentive to her because of my deprecating his self-devotion.</p>
<h2><a name="page112"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
112</span>XI</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">In</span> the intimacy that grew up
between my wife and Miss Gage I found myself less and less
included.&nbsp; It seemed to me at times that I might have gone
away from Saratoga and not been seriously missed by any one, but
perhaps this was not taking sufficient account of my value as a
spectator, by whom Mrs. March could verify her own
impressions.</p>
<p>The girl had never known a mother&rsquo;s care, and it was
affecting to see how willing she was to be mothered by the chance
kindness of a stranger.&nbsp; She probably felt more and more her
ignorance of the world as it unfolded itself to her in terms so
altogether strange to the life of De Witt Point.&nbsp; I was not
sure that she would have been so grateful for the efforts made
for her enjoyment if they had failed, but as the case stood she
was certainly grateful; my wife said that, and I saw it.&nbsp;
She seemed to have written home about us to her father, for she
read my wife part of a letter from him conveying his
&ldquo;respects,&rdquo; and asking her to thank us for him.&nbsp;
She came to me with the cheque it enclosed, and asked me to get
it cashed for her; it was for a handsome amount.&nbsp; But she
continued to go about at our cost, quite unconsciously, till one
day she happened to witness a contest of civility between
Kendricks and myself as to which should pay the carriage we were
dismissing.&nbsp; That night she came to Mrs. March, and, with
many blushes, asked to be allowed to pay for the past and future
her full share of the expense of our joint pleasures.&nbsp; She
said that she had never thought of it before, and she felt so
much ashamed.&nbsp; She could not be consoled till she was
promised that she should be indulged for the future, and that I
should be obliged to average the outlay already made and let her
pay a fourth.&nbsp; When she had gained her point, Mrs. March
said that she seemed a little scared, and said, &ldquo;I
haven&rsquo;t offended you, Mrs. March, have I?&nbsp; Because if
it isn&rsquo;t right for me to pay&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s quite right, my dear,&rdquo; said my wife,
&ldquo;and it&rsquo;s very nice of you to think of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know,&rdquo; the girl explained, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve
never been out a great deal at home even; and it&rsquo;s always
the custom there for the gentlemen to pay for a ride&mdash;or
dance&mdash;or anything; but this is different.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. March said &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; and, in the interest of
civilisation, she did a little missionary work.&nbsp; She told
her that in Boston the young ladies paid for their tickets to the
Harvard assemblies, and preferred to do it, because it left them
without even a tacit obligation.</p>
<p>Miss Gage said she had never heard of such a thing before, but
she could see how much better it was.</p>
<p>I do not think she got on with the Last Days of Pompeii very
rapidly; its immediate interest was superseded by other
things.&nbsp; But she always had the book about with her, and I
fancied that she tried to read it in those moments of relaxation
from our pleasuring when she might better have been day-dreaming,
though I dare say she did enough of that too.</p>
<p>What amused me in the affair was the celerity with which it
took itself out of our hands.&nbsp; In an incredibly short time
we had no longer the trouble of thinking what we should do for
Miss Gage; that was provided for by the forethought of Kendricks,
and our concern was how each could make the other go with the
young people on their excursions and expeditions.&nbsp; We had
seen and done all the things that they were doing, and it
presently bored us to chaperon them.&nbsp; After a good deal of
talking we arrived at a rough division of duty, and I went with
them walking and eating and drinking, and for anything involving
late hours, and Mrs. March presided at such things as carriage
exercise, concerts, and shopping.</p>
<p>There are not many public entertainments at Saratoga, except
such as the hotels supply; but a series of Salvation Army
meetings did duty as amusements, and there was one theatrical
performance&mdash;a performance of <i>East Lynne</i> entirely by
people of colour.&nbsp; The sentiments and incidents of the
heart-breaking melodrama, as the coloured mind interpreted them,
were of very curious effect.&nbsp; It was as if the version were
dyed with the same pigment that darkened the players&rsquo;
skins: it all came out negro.&nbsp; Yet they had tried to make it
white; I could perceive how they aimed not at the imitation of
our nature, but at the imitation of our convention; it was like
the play of children in that.&nbsp; I should have said that
nothing could be more false than the motives and emotions of the
drama as the author imagined them, but I had to own that their
rendition by these sincere souls was yet more artificial.&nbsp;
There was nothing traditional, nothing archaic, nothing
autochthonic in their poor art.&nbsp; If the scene could at any
moment have resolved myself into a walk-round, with an
interspersion of spirituals, it would have had the charm of
these; it would have consoled and edified; but as it was I have
seldom been so bored.&nbsp; I began to make some sad reflections,
as that our American society, in its endeavour for the effect of
European society, was of no truer ideal than these coloured
comedians, and I accused myself of a final absurdity in having
come there with these young people, who, according to our good
native usage, could have come perfectly well without me.&nbsp; At
the end of the first act I broke into their talk with my
conclusion that we must not count the histrionic talent among the
gifts of the African race just yet.&nbsp; We could concede them
music, I supposed, and there seemed to be hope for them, from
what they had some of them done, in the region of the plastic
arts; but apparently the stage was not for them, and this was all
the stranger because they were so imitative.&nbsp; Perhaps, I
said, it was an excess of self-consciousness which prevented
their giving themselves wholly to the art, and I began to speak
of the subjective and the objective, of the real and the ideal;
and whether it was that I became unintelligible as I became
metaphysical, I found Kendricks obviously not following me in the
incoherent replies he gave.&nbsp; Miss Gage had honestly made no
attempt to follow me.&nbsp; He asked, Why, didn&rsquo;t I think
it was pretty well done?&nbsp; They had enjoyed it very much, he
said.&nbsp; I could only stare in answer, and wonder what had
become of the man&rsquo;s tastes or his principles; he was either
humbugging himself or he was humbugging me.&nbsp; After that I
left them alone, and suffered through the rest of the play with
what relief I could get from laughing when the pathetic emotions
of the drama became too poignant.&nbsp; I decided that Kendricks
was absorbed in the study of his companion&rsquo;s mind, which
must be open to his contemporaneous eye as it could never have
been to my old-sighted glasses, and I envied him the knowledge he
was gaining of that type of American girl.&nbsp; It suddenly came
to me that he must be finding his account in this, and I felt a
little less regret for the waste of civilities, of attentions,
which sometimes seemed to me beyond her appreciation.</p>
<p>I, for my part, gave myself to the study of the types about
me, and I dwelt long and luxuriously upon the vision of a florid
and massive matron in diaphanous evening dress, whom I imagined
to be revisiting the glimpses of her girlhood in the ancient
watering-place, and to be getting all the gaiety she could out of
it.&nbsp; These are the figures one mostly sees at Saratoga;
there is very little youth of the present day there, but the
youth of the past abounds, with the belated yellow hair and the
purple moustaches, which gave a notion of greater wickedness in a
former generation.</p>
<p>I made my observation that the dress, even in extreme cases of
elderly prime, was very good&mdash;in the case of the women, I
mean; the men there, as everywhere with us, were mostly slovens;
and I was glad to find that the good taste and the correct
fashion were without a colour-line; there were some mulatto
ladies present as stylish as their white sisters, or
step-sisters.</p>
<p>The most amiable of the human race is in great force at
Saratoga, where the vast hotel service is wholly in its hands,
and it had honoured the effort of the comedians that night with a
full house of their own complexion.&nbsp; We who were not of it
showed strangely enough in the dark mass, who let us lead the
applause, however, as if doubtful themselves where it ought to
come in, and whom I found willing even to share some misplaced
laughter of mine.&nbsp; They formed two-thirds of the audience on
the floor, and they were a cloud in the gallery, scarcely broken
by a gleam of white.</p>
<p>I entertained myself with them a good deal, and I thought how
much more delightful they were in their own kindly character than
in their assumption of white character, and I tried to define my
suffering from the performance as an effect from my tormented
sympathies rather than from my offended tastes.&nbsp; When the
long stress was over, and we rose and stood to let the crowd get
out, I asked Miss Gage if she did not think this must be the
case.&nbsp; I do not suppose she was really much more experienced
in the theatre than the people on the stage, some of whom I
doubted to have ever seen a play till they took part in <i>East
Lynne</i>.&nbsp; But I thought I would ask her that in order to
hear what she would say; and she said very simply that she had
seen so few plays she did not know what to think of it, and I
could see that she was abashed by the fact.&nbsp; Kendricks must
have seen it too, for he began at once to save her from herself,
with all his subtle generosity, and to turn her shame to
praise.&nbsp; My heart, which remained sufficiently cold to her,
warmed more than ever to him, and I should have liked to tell her
that here was the finest and rarest human porcelain using itself
like common clay in her behalf, and to demand whether she thought
she was worth it.</p>
<p>I did not think she was, and I had a lurid moment when I was
tempted to push on and make her show herself somehow at her
worst.&nbsp; We had undertaken a preposterous thing in
befriending her as we had done, and our course in bringing
Kendricks in was wholly unjustifiable.&nbsp; How could I lead her
on to some betrayal of her essential Philistinism, and make her
so impossible in his eyes that even he, with all his sweetness
and goodness, must take the first train from Saratoga in the
morning?</p>
<p>We had of course joined the crowd in pushing forward; people
always do, though they promise themselves to wait till the last
one is out.&nbsp; I got caught in a dark eddy on the first
stair-landing; but I could see them farther down, and I knew they
would wait for me outside the door.</p>
<p>When I reached it at last they were nowhere to be seen; I
looked up this street and down that, but they were not in
sight.</p>
<h2><a name="page122"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
122</span>XII</h2>
<p>I <span class="smcap">did</span> not afflict myself very much,
nor pretend to do so.&nbsp; They knew the way home, and after I
had blundered about in search of them through the lampshot
darkness, I settled myself to walk back at my leisure,
comfortably sure that I should find them on the verandah waiting
for me when I reached the hotel.&nbsp; It was quite a thick
night, and I almost ran into a couple at a corner of our quieter
street when I had got to it out of Broadway.&nbsp; They seemed to
be standing and looking about, and when the man said, &ldquo;He
must have thought we took the first turn,&rdquo; and the woman,
&ldquo;Yes, that must have been the way,&rdquo; I recognised my
estrays.</p>
<p>I thought I would not discover myself to them, but follow on,
and surprise them by arriving at our steps at the same moment
they did, and I prepared myself to hurry after them.&nbsp; But
they seemed in no hurry, and I had even some difficulty in
accommodating my pace to the slowness of theirs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Won&rsquo;t you take my arm, Miss Gage?&rdquo; he asked
as they moved on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s so <i>very</i> dark,&rdquo; she answered,
and I knew she had taken it.&nbsp; &ldquo;I can hardly see a
step, and poor Mr. March with his glasses&mdash;I don&rsquo;t
know what he&rsquo;ll do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, he only uses them to read with; he can see as well
as we can in the dark.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s very young in his feelings,&rdquo; said the
girl; &ldquo;he puts me in mind of my own father.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s very young in his thoughts,&rdquo; said
Kendricks; &ldquo;and that&rsquo;s much more to the purpose for a
magazine editor.&nbsp; There are very few men of his age who keep
in touch with the times as he does.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Still, Mrs. March seems a good deal younger,
don&rsquo;t you think?&nbsp; I wonder how soon they begin to feel
old?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, not till along in the forties, I should say.&nbsp;
It&rsquo;s a good deal in temperament.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t
suppose that either of them realises yet that they&rsquo;re old,
and they must be nearly fifty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How strange it must be,&rdquo; said the girl,
&ldquo;fifty years old!&nbsp; Twenty seems old enough, goodness
knows.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How should you like to be a dotard of
twenty-seven?&rdquo; Kendricks asked, and she laughed at his
joke.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t suppose I should mind it so much if I
were a man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I had promised myself that if the talk became at all
confidential I would drop behind out of earshot; but though it
was curiously intimate for me to be put apart in the minds of
these young people on account of my years as not of the same race
or fate as themselves, there was nothing in what they said that I
might not innocently overhear, as far as they were concerned, and
I listened on.</p>
<p>But they had apparently given me quite enough attention.&nbsp;
After some mutual laughter at what she said last, they were
silent a moment, and then he said soberly, &ldquo;There&rsquo;s
something fine in this isolation the dark gives you, isn&rsquo;t
there?&nbsp; You&rsquo;re as remote in it from our own time and
place as if you were wandering in interplanetary
space.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose we <i>are</i> doing that all the
time&mdash;on the earth,&rdquo; she suggested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; but how hard it is to realise that we are on the
earth now.&nbsp; Sometimes I have a sense of it, though, when the
moon breaks from one flying cloud to another.&nbsp; Then it seems
as if I were a passenger on some vast, shapeless ship sailing
through the air.&nbsp; What,&rdquo; he asked, with no relevancy
that I could perceive, &ldquo;was the strangest feeling
<i>you</i> ever had?&rdquo;&nbsp; I remembered asking girls such
questions when I was young, and their not apparently thinking it
at all odd.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; she returned
thoughtfully.&nbsp; &ldquo;There was one time when I was little,
and it had sleeted, and the sun came out just before it set, and
seemed to set all the woods on fire.&nbsp; I thought the world
was burning up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It must have been very weird,&rdquo; said Kendricks;
and I thought, &ldquo;Oh, good heavens!&nbsp; Has he got to
talking of weird things?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s strange,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;how we all
have that belief when we are children that the world is going to
burn up!&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t suppose any child escapes it.&nbsp;
Do you remember that poem of Thompson&rsquo;s&mdash;the <i>City
of Dreadful Night</i> man&mdash;where he describes the end of the
world?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I never read it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, merely, he says when the conflagration began the
little flames looked like crocuses breaking through the
sod.&nbsp; If it ever happened I fancy it would be quite as
simple as that.&nbsp; But perhaps you don&rsquo;t like gloomy
poetry?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, yes, I do.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s the only kind that I
care about.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you hate funny poetry?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think it&rsquo;s disgusting.&nbsp; Papa is always
cutting it out of the papers and wanting to send it to me, and we
have the greatest <i>times</i>!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose,&rdquo; said Kendricks, &ldquo;it expresses
some moods, though.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh yes; it expresses some moods; and sometimes it makes
me laugh in spite of myself, and ashamed of anything
serious.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s always the effect of a farce with
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But then I&rsquo;m ashamed of being ashamed
afterward,&rdquo; said the girl.&nbsp; &ldquo;I suppose you go to
the theatre a great deal in New York.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a school of life,&rdquo; said
Kendricks.&nbsp; &ldquo;I mean the audience.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I would like to go to the opera once.&nbsp; I am going
to make papa take me in the winter.&rdquo;&nbsp; She laughed with
a gay sense of power, and he said&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You seem to be great friends with your
father.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, we&rsquo;re always together.&nbsp; I always went
everywhere with him; this is the first time I&rsquo;ve been away
without him.&nbsp; But I thought I&rsquo;d come with Mrs. Deering
and see what Saratoga was like; I had never been here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And is it like what you thought?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No.&nbsp; The first week we didn&rsquo;t do
anything.&nbsp; Then we got acquainted with Mr. and Mrs. March,
and I began to really see something.&nbsp; But I supposed it was
all balls and gaiety.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We must get up a few if you&rsquo;re so fond of
them,&rdquo; Kendricks playfully suggested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t know as I am.&nbsp; I never went much
at home.&nbsp; Papa didn&rsquo;t care to have me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, do you think it was right for him to keep you all
to himself?&rdquo;&nbsp; The girl did not answer, and they had
both halted so abruptly that I almost ran into them.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t quite make out where we are.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Kendricks seemed to be peering about.&nbsp; I plunged across the
street lest he should ask me.&nbsp; I heard him add, &ldquo;Oh
yes; I know now,&rdquo; and then they pressed forward.</p>
<p>We were quite near our hotel, but I thought it best to walk
round the square and let them arrive first.&nbsp; On the way I
amused myself thinking how different the girl had shown herself
to him from what she had ever shown herself to my wife or
me.&nbsp; She had really, this plain-minded goddess, a vein of
poetic feeling, some inner beauty of soul answering to the outer
beauty of body.&nbsp; She had a romantic attachment to her
father, and this shed a sort of light on both of them, though I
knew that it was not always a revelation of character.</p>
<h2><a name="page129"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
129</span>XIII</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">When</span> I reached the hotel I found
Miss Gage at the door, and Kendricks coming out of the office
toward her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, here he is!&rdquo; she called to him at sight of
me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where in the world have you been?&rdquo; he
demanded.&nbsp; &ldquo;I had just found out from the clerk that
you hadn&rsquo;t come in yet, and I was going back for you with a
searchlight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I wasn&rsquo;t so badly lost as all that,&rdquo; I
returned.&nbsp; &ldquo;I missed you in the crowd at the door, but
I knew you&rsquo;d get home somehow, and so I came on without
you.&nbsp; But my aged steps are not so quick as
yours.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The words, mechanically uttered, suggested something, and I
thought that if they were in for weirdness I would give them as
much weirdness as they could ask for.&nbsp; &ldquo;When you get
along toward fifty you&rsquo;ll find that the foot you&rsquo;ve
still got out of the grave doesn&rsquo;t work so lively as it
used.&nbsp; Besides, I was interested in the night effect.&nbsp;
It&rsquo;s so gloriously dark; and I had a fine sense of
isolation as I came along, as if I were altogether out of my
epoch and my environment.&nbsp; I felt as if the earth was a sort
of <i>Flying Dutchman</i>, and I was the only passenger.&nbsp; It
was about the weirdest sensation I ever had.&nbsp; It reminded
me, I don&rsquo;t know how, exactly of the feeling I had when I
was young, and I saw the sunset one evening through the woods
after a sleet-storm.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They stared at each other as I went on, and I could see
Kendricks&rsquo;s fine eyes kindle with an imaginative
appreciation of the literary quality of the coincidence.&nbsp;
But when I added, &ldquo;Did you ever read a poem about the end
of the world by that City of Dreadful Night man?&rdquo; Miss Gage
impulsively caught me by the coat lapel and shook me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, it was you all the time!&nbsp; I knew there was
somebody following us, and I might have <i>known</i> who it
was!&rdquo;</p>
<p>We all gave way in a gale of laughter, and sat down on the
verandah and had our joke out in full recognition of the
fact.&nbsp; When Kendricks rose to go at last, I said, &ldquo;We
won&rsquo;t say anything about this little incident to Mrs.
March, hey?&rdquo;&nbsp; And then they laughed again as if it
were the finest wit in the world, and Miss Gage bade me a joyful
good-night at the head of the stairs as she went off to her room
and I to mine.</p>
<p>I found Mrs. March waiting up with a book; and as soon as I
shut myself in with her she said, awfully, &ldquo;What
<i>were</i> you laughing so about?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Laughing?&nbsp; Did you hear me laughing?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The whole house heard you, I&rsquo;m afraid.&nbsp; You
certainly ought to have known better, Basil.&nbsp; It was very
inconsiderate of you.&rdquo;&nbsp; And as I saw she was going on
with more of that sort of thing, to divert her thoughts from my
crime I told her the whole story.&nbsp; It had quite the effect I
intended up to a certain point.&nbsp; She even smiled a little,
as much as a woman could be expected to smile who was not
originally in the joke.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And they had got to comparing weird experiences?&rdquo;
she asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; the staleness of the thing almost made me
sick.&nbsp; Do you remember when we first compared our weird
experiences?&nbsp; But I suppose they will go on doing it to the
end of time, and it will have as great a charm for the last man
and woman as it had for Adam and Eve when they compared
<i>their</i> weird experiences.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And was that what you were laughing at?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We were laughing at the wonderful case of telepathy I
put up on them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. March faced her open book down on the table before her,
and looked at me with profound solemnity.&nbsp; &ldquo;Well,
then, I can tell you, my dear, it is no laughing matter.&nbsp; If
they have got to the weird it is very serious; and her talking to
him about her family, and his wanting to know about her father,
that&rsquo;s serious too&mdash;far more serious than either of
them can understand.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t like it, Basil; we have
got a terrible affair on our hands.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Terrible?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, terrible.&nbsp; As long as he was interested in
her simply from a literary point of view, though I didn&rsquo;t
like that either, I could put up with it; but now that he&rsquo;s
got to telling her about himself, and exchanging weird
experiences with her, it&rsquo;s another thing altogether.&nbsp;
Oh, I never wanted Kendricks brought into the affair at
all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come now, Isabel!&nbsp; Stick to the facts,
please.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No matter!&nbsp; It was you that discovered the girl,
and then something had to be done.&nbsp; I was perfectly shocked
when you told me that Mr. Kendricks was in town, because I saw at
once that he would have to be got in for it; and now we have to
think what we shall do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Couldn&rsquo;t we think better in the
morning?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No; we must think at once.&nbsp; I shall not sleep
to-night anyhow.&nbsp; My peace is gone.&nbsp; I shall have to
watch them every instant.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Beginning at this instant.&nbsp; Why not wait till you
can see them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, you can&rsquo;t joke it away, my dear.&nbsp; If I
find they are really interested in each other I shall have to
speak.&nbsp; I am responsible.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The young lady,&rdquo; I said, more to gain time than
anything else, &ldquo;seems quite capable of taking care of
herself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That makes it all the worse.&nbsp; Do you think I care
for her only?&nbsp; It&rsquo;s Kendricks too that I care
for.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t know that I care for her at
all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, then I think we may fairly leave Kendricks to his
own devices; and I&rsquo;m not alarmed for Miss Gage either,
though I do care for her a great deal.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand how you can be so heartless
about it, Basil,&rdquo; said Mrs. March, plaintively.&nbsp;
&ldquo;She is a young girl, and she has never seen anything of
the world, and of course if he keeps on paying her attention in
this way she can&rsquo;t help thinking that he is interested in
her.&nbsp; Men never can see such things as women do.&nbsp; They
think that, until a man has actually asked a girl to marry him,
he hasn&rsquo;t done anything to warrant her in supposing that he
is in love with her, or that she has any right to be in love with
him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is true; we can&rsquo;t imagine that she would be
so indelicate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see that you&rsquo;re determined to tease, my
dear,&rdquo; said Mrs. March, and she took up her book with an
air of offence and dismissal.&nbsp; &ldquo;If you won&rsquo;t
talk seriously, I hope you will think seriously, and try to
realise what we&rsquo;ve got in for.&nbsp; Such a girl
couldn&rsquo;t imagine that we had simply got Mr. Kendricks to go
about with her from a romantic wish to make her have a good time,
and that he was doing it to oblige us, and wasn&rsquo;t at all
interested in her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It does look a little preposterous, even to the
outsider,&rdquo; I admitted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am glad you are beginning to see it in that light, my
dear, and if you can think of anything to do by morning I shall
be humbly thankful.&nbsp; <i>I</i> don&rsquo;t expect
to.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps I shall dream of something,&rdquo; I said more
lightly than I felt.&nbsp; &ldquo;How would it do for you to have
a little talk with her&mdash;a little motherly talk&mdash;and
hint round, and warn her not to let her feelings run away with
her in Kendricks&rsquo;s direction?&rdquo;&nbsp; Mrs. March faced
her book down in her lap, and listened as if there might be some
reason in the nonsense I was talking.&nbsp; &ldquo;You might say
that he was a society man, and was in great request, and then
intimate that there was a prior attachment, or that he was the
kind of man who would never marry, but was really cold-hearted
with all his sweetness, and merely had a passion for studying
character.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you think that would do, Basil?&rdquo; she
asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I thought perhaps you might think so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid it wouldn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; she
sighed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All that we can do now is to watch them, and act
promptly, if we see that they are really in love, either of
them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;that I
should know that they were in love even if I saw it.&nbsp; I have
forgotten the outward signs, if I ever knew them.&nbsp; Should he
give her flowers?&nbsp; He&rsquo;s done it from the start;
he&rsquo;s brought her boxes of Huyler candy, and lent her books;
but I dare say he&rsquo;s been merely complying with our wishes
in doing it.&nbsp; I doubt if lovers sigh nowadays.&nbsp; I
didn&rsquo;t sigh myself, even in my time; and I don&rsquo;t
believe any passion could make Kendricks neglect his dress.&nbsp;
He keeps his eyes on her all the time, but that may be merely an
effort to divine her character.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t believe I
should know, indeed I don&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall,&rdquo; said Mrs. March.</p>
<h2><a name="page137"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
137</span>XIV</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">We</span> were to go the next day to the
races, and I woke with more anxiety about the weather than about
the lovers, or potential lovers.&nbsp; But after realising that
the day was beautiful, on that large scale of loveliness which
seems characteristic of the summer days at Saratoga, where they
have them almost the size of the summer days I knew when I was a
boy, I was sensible of a secondary worry in my mind, which
presently related itself to Kendricks and Miss Gage.&nbsp; It was
a haze of trouble merely, however, such as burns off, like a
morning fog, when the sun gets higher, and it was chiefly on my
wife&rsquo;s account.</p>
<p>I suppose that the great difference between her conscience and
one originating outside of New England (if any conscience can
originate outside of New England) is that it cannot leave the
moral government of the universe in the hands of divine
Providence.&nbsp; I was willing to leave so many things which I
could not control to the Deity, who probably could that she
accused me of fatalism, and I was held to be little better than
one of the wicked because I would not forecast the effects of
what I did in the lives of others.&nbsp; I insisted that others
were also probably in the hands of the <i>somma sapienza e il
primo amore</i>, and that I was so little aware of the influence
of other lives upon my own, even where there had been a direct
and strenuous effort to affect me, that I could not readily
believe others had swerved from the line of their destiny because
of me.&nbsp; Especially I protested that I could not hold myself
guilty of misfortunes I had not intended, even though my faulty
conduct had caused them.&nbsp; As to this business of Kendricks
and Miss Gage, I denied in the dispute I now began tacitly to
hold with Mrs. March&rsquo;s conscience that my conduct had been
faulty.&nbsp; I said that there was no earthly harm in my having
been interested by the girl&rsquo;s forlornness when I first saw
her; that I did not do wrong to interest Mrs. March in her; that
she did not sin in going shopping with Miss Gage and Mrs.
Deering; that we had not sinned, either of us, in rejoicing that
Kendricks had come to Saratoga, or in letting Mrs. Deering go
home to her sick husband and leave Miss Gage on our hands; that
we were not wicked in permitting the young fellow to help us make
her have a good time.&nbsp; In this colloquy I did all the
reasoning, and Mrs. March&rsquo;s conscience was completely
silenced; but it rose triumphant in my miserable soul when I met
Miss Gage at breakfast, looking radiantly happy, and disposed to
fellowship me in an unusual confidence because, as I clearly
perceived, of our last night&rsquo;s adventure.&nbsp; I said to
myself bitterly that happiness did not become her style, and I
hoped that she would get away with her confounded rapture before
Mrs. March came down.&nbsp; I resolved not to tell Mrs. March if
it fell out so, but at the same time, as a sort of atonement, I
decided to begin keeping the sharpest kind of watch upon Miss
Gage for the outward signs and tokens of love.</p>
<p>She said, &ldquo;When you began to talk that way last night,
Mr. March, it almost took my breath, and if you hadn&rsquo;t gone
so far, and mentioned about the sunset through the sleety trees,
I never should have suspected you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, that&rsquo;s the trouble with men, Miss
Gage.&rdquo;&nbsp; And when I said &ldquo;men&rdquo; I fancied
she flushed a little.&nbsp; &ldquo;We never know when to stop; we
always overdo it; if it were not for that we should be as perfect
as women.&nbsp; Perhaps you&rsquo;ll give me another chance,
though.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No; we shall be on our guard after this.&rdquo;&nbsp;
She corrected herself and said, &ldquo;I shall always be looking
out for you now,&rdquo; and she certainly showed herself
conscious in the bridling glance that met my keen gaze.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good heavens!&rdquo; I thought.&nbsp; &ldquo;Has it
really gone so far?&rdquo; and more than ever I resolved not to
tell Mrs. March.</p>
<p>I went out to engage a carriage to take us to the races, and
to agree with the driver that he should wait for us at a certain
corner some blocks distant from our hotel, where we were to walk
and find him.&nbsp; We always did this, because there were a
number of clergymen in our house, and Mrs. March could not make
it seem right to start for the races direct from the door, though
she held that it was perfectly right for us to go.&nbsp; For the
same reason she made the driver stop short of our destination on
our return, and walked home the rest of the way.&nbsp; Almost the
first time we practised this deception I was met at the door by
the sweetest and dearest of these old divines, who said,
&ldquo;Have you ever seen the races here?&nbsp; I&rsquo;m told
the spectacle is something very fine,&rdquo; and I was obliged to
own that I had once had a glimpse of them.&nbsp; But it was in
vain that I pleaded this fact with Mrs. March; she insisted that
the appearance of not going to the races was something that we
owed the cloth, and no connivance on their part could dispense us
from it.</p>
<p>As I now went looking up and down the street for the driver
who was usually on the watch for me about eleven o&rsquo;clock on
a fair day of the races, I turned over in my mind the several
accidents which are employed in novels to bring young people to a
realising sense of their feelings toward each other, and wondered
which of them I might most safely invoke.&nbsp; I was not anxious
to have Kendricks and Miss Gage lovers; it would be altogether
simpler for us if they were not; but if they were, the sooner
they knew it and we knew it the better.&nbsp; I thought of a
carriage accident, in which he should seize her and leap with her
from the flying vehicle, while the horses plunged madly on, but I
did not know what in this case would become of Mrs. March and
me.&nbsp; Besides, I could think of nothing that would frighten
our driver&rsquo;s horses, and I dismissed the fleeting notion of
getting any others because Mrs. March liked their being so safe,
and she had, besides, interested herself particularly in the
driver, who had a family and counted upon our custom.&nbsp; The
poor fellow came in sight presently, and smilingly made the usual
arrangement with me, and an hour later he delivered us all sound
in wind and limb at the racecourse.</p>
<p>I watched in vain for signs of uncommon tenderness in the two
young people.&nbsp; If anything they were rather stiff and
distant with each other, and I asked myself whether this might
not be from an access of consciousness.&nbsp; Kendricks was
particularly devoted to Mrs. March, who, in the airy detachment
with which she responded to his attentions, gave me the
impression that she had absolutely dismissed her suspicions of
the night before, or else had heartlessly abandoned the affair to
me altogether.&nbsp; If she had really done this, then I saw no
way out of it for me but by an accident which should reveal them
to each other.&nbsp; Perhaps some one might insult Miss
Gage&mdash;some ruffian&mdash;and Kendricks might strike the
fellow; but this seemed too squalid.&nbsp; There might be a
terrible jam, and he interpose his person between her and the
danger of her being crushed to death; or the floor of the grand
stand might give way, and everybody be precipitated into the
space beneath, and he fight his way, with her senseless form on
his arm, over the bodies of the mangled and dying.&nbsp; Any of
these things would have availed in a novel, and something of the
kind would have happened, too.&nbsp; But, to tell the truth,
nothing whatever happened, and if it had not been for that
anxiety on my mind I should have thought it much pleasanter
so.</p>
<p>Even as it was I felt a measure of the hilarity which commonly
fills me at a running race, and I began to lose in the charm of
the gay scene the sense of my responsibility, and little by
little to abate the vigilance apparently left all to me.&nbsp;
The day was beautiful; the long heat had burned itself out, and
there was a clear sparkle in the sunshine, which seemed blown
across the wide space within the loop of the track by the
delicate breeze.&nbsp; A vague, remote smell of horses haunted
the air, with now and then a breath of the pines from the grove
shutting the race-ground from the highway.&nbsp; We got excellent
places, as one always may, the grand stand is so vast, and the
young people disposed themselves on the bench in front of us, but
so near that we were not tempted to talk them over.&nbsp; The
newsboys came round with papers, and the boys who sold programmes
of the races; from the bar below there appeared from time to time
shining negroes in white linen jackets, with trays bearing tall
glasses of lemonade, and straws tilted in the glasses.&nbsp;
Bookmakers from the pool-rooms took the bets of the ladies, who
formed by far the greater part of the spectators on the grand
stand, and contributed, with their summer hats and gowns, to the
gaiety of the <i>ensemble</i>.&nbsp; They were of all types, city
and country both, and of the Southern dark as well as the
Northern fair complexion, with so thick a sprinkling of South
Americans that the Spanish gutturals made themselves almost as
much heard as the Yankee nasals.&nbsp; Among them moved two nuns
of some mendicant order, receiving charity from the fair
gamblers, who gave for luck without distinction of race or
religion.</p>
<p>I leaned forward and called Kendricks&rsquo;s attention to the
nuns, and to the admirable literary quality of the whole
situation.&nbsp; He was talking to Miss Gage, and he said as
impatiently as he ever suffered himself to speak, &ldquo;Yes,
yes; tremendously picturesque.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You ought to get something out of it, my dear
fellow.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t you feel copy in it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, splendid, of course; but it&rsquo;s your ground,
Mr. March.&nbsp; I shouldn&rsquo;t feel it right to do anything
with Saratoga after you had discovered it,&rdquo; and he turned
eagerly again to Miss Gage.</p>
<p>My wife put her hand on my sleeve and frowned, and I had so
far lost myself in my appreciation of the scene that I was going
to ask her what the matter was, when a general sensation about me
made me look at the track, where the horses for the first race
had already appeared, with their jockeys in vivid silk jackets of
various dyes.&nbsp; They began to form for the start with the
usual tricks and feints, till I became very indignant with them,
though I had no bets pending, and did not care in the least which
horse won.&nbsp; What I wanted was to see the race, the flight,
and all this miserable manoeuvring was retarding it.&nbsp; Now
and then a jockey rode his horse far off on the track and came
back between the false starts; now and then one kept stubbornly
behind the rest and would not start with them.&nbsp; How their
several schemes and ambitions were finally reconciled I never
could tell, but at last the starter&rsquo;s flag swept down and
they were really off.&nbsp; Everybody could have seen perfectly
well as they sat, but everybody rose and watched the swift swoop
of the horses, bunched together in the distance, and scarcely
distinguishable by the colours of their riders.&nbsp; The supreme
moment came for me when they were exactly opposite the grand
stand, full half a mile away&mdash;the moment that I remembered
from year to year as one of exquisite illusion&mdash;for then the
horses seemed to lift from the earth as with wings, and to skim
over the track like a covey of low-flying birds.&nbsp; The finish
was tame to this.&nbsp; Mrs. March and I had our wonted
difference of opinion as to which horse had won, and we were
rather uncommonly controversial because we had both decided upon
the same horse, as we found, only she was talking of the
jockey&rsquo;s colours, and I was talking of the
horse&rsquo;s.&nbsp; We appealed to Kendricks, who said that
another horse altogether had won the race, and this compromise
pacified us.</p>
<p>We were all on foot, and he suggested, &ldquo;We could see
better, couldn&rsquo;t we, if we went farther down in
front?&rdquo;&nbsp; And Mrs. March answered&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, we prefer to stay here; but you two can
go.&rdquo;&nbsp; And when they had promptly availed themselves of
her leave, she said to me, &ldquo;This is killing me dead, Basil,
and if it keeps up much longer I don&rsquo;t believe I can live
through it.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t care now, and I believe I shall
throw them together all I can from this out.&nbsp; The quicker
they decide whether they&rsquo;re in love or not the
better.&nbsp; <i>I</i> have some rights too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her whirling words expressed the feeling in my own mind.&nbsp;
I had the same sense of being trifled with by these young people,
who would not behave so conclusively toward each other as to
justify our interference on the ground that they were in love,
nor yet treat each other so indifferently as to relieve us of the
strain of apprehension.&nbsp; I had lost all faith in accident by
this time, and I was quite willing to leave them to their own
devices; I was so desperate that I said I hoped they would get
lost from us, as they had from me the night before, and never
come back, but just keep on wandering round for ever.&nbsp; All
sorts of vengeful thoughts went through my mind as I saw them
leaning toward each other to say something, and then drawing
apart to laugh in what seemed an indefinite comradery instead of
an irrepressible passion.&nbsp; Did they think we were going to
let this sort of thing go on?&nbsp; What did they suppose our
nerves were made of?&nbsp; Had they no mercy, no
consideration?&nbsp; It was quite like the selfishness of youth
to wish to continue in that fool&rsquo;s paradise, but they would
find out that middle age had its rights too.&nbsp; I felt capable
of asking them bluntly what they meant by it.&nbsp; But when they
docilely rejoined us at the end of the races, hurrying up with
some joke about not letting me get lost this time, and Miss Gage
put herself at my wife&rsquo;s side and Kendricks dropped into
step with me, all I had been thinking seemed absurd.&nbsp; They
were just two young people who were enjoying a holiday-time
together, and we were in no wise culpable concerning them.</p>
<p>I suggested this to Mrs. March when we got home, and, in the
need of some relief from the tension she had been in, she was
fain to accept the theory provisionally, though I knew that her
later rejection of it would be all the more violent for this
respite.</p>
<h2><a name="page150"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
150</span>XV</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">There</span> was to be a hop at the Grand
Union that night, and I had got tickets for it in virtue of my
relation to <i>Every Other Week</i>.&nbsp; I must say the clerk
who gave them me was very civil about it; he said they were
really only for the hotel guests, but he was glad to give them to
outsiders who applied with proper credentials; and he even
offered me more tickets than I asked for.</p>
<p>Miss Gage was getting a dress for the hop, and it was to be
finished that day.&nbsp; I think women really like the scare of
thinking their dresses will not be done for a given occasion, and
so arrange to have them at the last moment.&nbsp; Mrs. March went
with the girl early in the afternoon to have it tried on for the
last time, and they came home reporting that it was a poem.&nbsp;
My wife confided to me that it was not half done&mdash;merely
begun, in fact&mdash;and would never be finished in time in the
world.&nbsp; She also assured Miss Gage that she need not be the
least uneasy; that there was not an hour&rsquo;s work on the
dress; and that the dress-maker&rsquo;s reputation was at stake,
and she would not dare to fail her.&nbsp; I knew she was
perfectly sincere in both these declarations, which were, indeed,
merely the expression of two mental attitudes, and had no
relation to the facts.</p>
<p>She added to me that she was completely worn out with anxiety
and worry, and I must not think of her going to the hop.&nbsp; I
would have to do the chaperoning for her, and she did hope that I
would not forget what I was sent for, or get talking with
somebody, and leave Miss Gage altogether to Kendricks.&nbsp; She
said that quite likely there might be friends or acquaintances of
his at the hop&mdash;such a large affair&mdash;whom he would want
to show some attention, and I must take charge of Miss Gage
myself, and try to find her other partners.&nbsp; She drilled me
in the duties of my position until I believed that I was
letter-perfect, and then she said that she supposed I would
commit some terrible blunder that would ruin everything.</p>
<p>I thought that this was very likely, too, but I would not
admit it.</p>
<p>The dress came home at nine o&rsquo;clock, and operated a
happy diversion from my imaginable shortcomings; for it appeared
from Mrs. March&rsquo;s asides to me that it was a perfect horror
in the set, and that everybody could see that it had been simply
<i>slung</i> together at the last moment, and she would never, as
long as the world stood, go to that woman for anything again.</p>
<p>I must say I could not myself see anything wrong about the
dress.&nbsp; I thought it exquisite in tint and texture; a
delicate, pale-greenish film that clung and floated, and set off
the girl&rsquo;s beauty as the leafage of a flower heightens the
loveliness of a flower.&nbsp; I did not dare to say this in the
face of Mrs. March&rsquo;s private despair, and I was silent
while the girl submitted to be twirled about for my inspection
like a statue on a revolving pedestal.&nbsp; Kendricks, however,
had no such restrictions upon him, and I could see him start with
delight in the splendid vision before he spoke.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Isn&rsquo;t</i> it a poem?&rdquo; demanded Mrs.
March.&nbsp; &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it a perfect
<i>lyric</i>?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why should you have allowed her to be transported
altogether into the ideal?&nbsp; Wasn&rsquo;t she far enough from
us before?&rdquo; he asked; and I found myself wishing that he
would be either less or more articulate.&nbsp; He ought to have
been mute with passion, or else he ought to have been frankly
voluble about the girl&rsquo;s gown, and gone on about it
longer.&nbsp; But he simply left the matter there, and though I
kept him carefully under my eye, I could not see that he was
concealing any further emotion.&nbsp; She, on her part, neither
blushed nor frowned at his compliment; she did nothing by look or
gesture to provoke more praise; she took it very much as the
beautiful evening might, so undeniably fine, so perfect in its
way.</p>
<p>She and the evening were equally fitted for the event to which
they seemed equally dedicated.&nbsp; The dancing was to be out of
doors on a vast planking, or platform, set up in the heart of
that bosky court which the hotel incloses.&nbsp; Around this
platform drooped the slim, tall Saratogan trees, and over it hung
the Saratogan sky, of a nocturnal blue very rare in our latitude,
with the stars faint in its depths, and by and by a white moon
that permitted itself a modest competition with the electric
lights effulgent everywhere.&nbsp; There was a great crowd of
people in the portico, the vestibule, and the inner piazzas, and
on the lawn around the platform, where &ldquo;the trodden
weed&rdquo; sent up the sweet scent of bruised grass in the cool
night air.&nbsp; My foolish old heart bounded with a pulse of
youth at the thought of all the gay and tender possibilities of
such a scene.</p>
<p>But the young people under my care seemed in no haste to
mingle in it.&nbsp; We oldsters are always fancying youth
impatient, but there is no time of life which has so much
patience.&nbsp; It behaves as if it had eternity before
it&mdash;an eternity of youth&mdash;instead of a few days and
years, and then the frosty poll.&nbsp; We who are young no longer
think we would do so and so if we were young, as women think they
would do so and so if they were men; but if we were really young
again, we should not do at all what we think.&nbsp; We should not
hurry to experience our emotions; we should not press forward to
discharge our duties or repair our mistakes; we should not seize
the occasion to make a friend or reconcile an enemy; we should
let weeks and months go by in the realisation of a passion, and
trust all sorts of contingencies and accidents to help us out
with its confession.&nbsp; The thoughts of youth are very long,
and its conclusions are deliberate and delayed, and often
withheld altogether.&nbsp; It is age which is tremulously eager
in these matters, and cannot wait with the fine patience of
nature in her growing moods.</p>
<p>As soon, even, as I was in the hotel I was impatient to press
through to the place where the dancing was, and where I already
heard the band playing.&nbsp; I knew very well that when we got
there I should have to sit down somewhere on the edge of the
platform with the other frumps and fogies, and begin taking cold
in my dress-coat, and want to doze off without being able to,
while my young people were waltzing together, or else promenading
up and down ignoring me, or recognising me by the offer of a fan,
and the question whether I was not simply melting; I have seen
how the poor chaperon fares at such times.&nbsp; But they, secure
of their fun, were by no means desirous to have it over, or even
to have it begin.&nbsp; They dawdled through the thronged hotel
office, where other irresponsible pairs were coming and going
under the admiring eyes of the hotel loungers, and they wandered
up and down the waste parlours, and sat on
<i>t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;tes</i> just to try them,
apparently; and Miss Gage verified in the mirrors the beauty
which was reflected in all eyes.&nbsp; They amused themselves
with the extent of the richly-carpeted and upholstered desolation
around them, where only a few lonely and aging women lurked about
on sofas and ottomans; and they fell to playing with their
compassion for the plebeian spectators at the long verandah
windows trying to penetrate with their forbidden eyes to the hop
going on in the court far beyond the intermediary desert of the
parlours.</p>
<p>When they signified at last that they were ready for me to
lead them on to the dance, I would so much rather have gone to
bed that there are no words for the comparison.&nbsp; Then, when
we got to the place, which I should never have been able to reach
in the world if it had not been for the young energy and
inspiration of Kendricks, and they had put me in a certain seat
with Miss Gage&rsquo;s wraps beside me where they could find me,
they went off and danced for hours and hours.&nbsp; For hours and
hours?&nbsp; For ages and ages! while I withered away amid
mouldering mothers, and saw my charges through the dreadful
half-dreams of such a state whirling in the waltz, hopping in the
polka, sliding in the galop, and then endlessly walking up and
down between the dances, and eating and drinking the chill
refreshments that it made my teeth chatter to think of.&nbsp; I
suppose they decently came to me from time to time, though they
seemed to be always dancing, for I could afterward remember Miss
Gage taking a wrap from me now and then, and quickly coming back
to shed it upon my lap again.&nbsp; I got so chilled that if they
had not been unmistakably women&rsquo;s wraps I should have
bundled them all about my shoulders, which I could almost hear
creak with rheumatism.&nbsp; I must have fallen into a sort of
drowse at last; for I was having a dispute with some sort of
authority, which turned out to be Mrs. March, and upbraiding her
with the fact that there were no women&rsquo;s wraps which would
also do for a man, when the young people stood arm in arm before
me, and Miss Gage said that she was tired to death now, and they
were going.</p>
<p>But it appeared that they were only going as far as the
parlours for the present; for when they re-entered the hotel,
they turned into them, and sat down there quite as if that had
been the understanding.&nbsp; When I arrived with the wraps, I
was reminded of something, and I said, &ldquo;Have you two been
dancing together the whole evening?&rdquo;</p>
<p>They looked at each other as if for the first time they now
realised the fact, and Kendricks said, &ldquo;Why, of course we
have!&nbsp; We didn&rsquo;t know anybody.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well, then,&rdquo; I said; &ldquo;you have got me
into a scrape.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, poor Mr. March!&rdquo; cried the girl.&nbsp;
&ldquo;How have we done it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, Mrs. March said that Mr. Kendricks would be sure
to know numbers of people, and I must get you other partners, for
it wouldn&rsquo;t do for you to dance the whole evening
together.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She threw herself back in the chair she had taken, and laughed
as if this were the best joke in the world.</p>
<p>He said hardily, &ldquo;You see it <i>has</i> done.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And if it wouldn&rsquo;t do,&rdquo; she gasped,
&ldquo;why didn&rsquo;t you bring me the other
partners?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because I didn&rsquo;t know any,&rdquo; I said; and
this seemed to amuse them both so much that I was afraid they
would never get their breath.</p>
<p>She looked by and by at her dancing-card, and as soon as she
could wipe the tears from her eyes she said, &ldquo;No; there is
no other name there&rdquo;; and this seemed even a better joke
than the other from the way they joined in laughing at it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, now,&rdquo; I said, when they were quiet again,
&ldquo;this won&rsquo;t do, my young friends.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s
all very well for you, and you seem to like it; but I am
responsible for your having passed a proper evening under my
chaperonage, and something has got to be done to prove
it.&rdquo;&nbsp; They saw the reasonableness of this, and they
immediately became sober.&nbsp; &ldquo;Kendricks,&rdquo; I asked,
&ldquo;can&rsquo;t you think of something?&rdquo;</p>
<p>No, he said, he couldn&rsquo;t; and then he began to laugh
again.</p>
<p>I applied to her in the same terms; but she only answered,
&ldquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t ask <i>me</i>,&rdquo; and she went off
laughing too.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well, then,&rdquo; I said; &ldquo;I shall have to
do something desperate, and I shall expect you both to bear me
out in it, and I don&rsquo;t want any miserable subterfuges when
it comes to the point with Mrs. March.&nbsp; Will you let me have
your dancing-card Miss Gage?&rdquo;&nbsp; She detached it, and
handed it to me.&nbsp; &ldquo;It&rsquo;s very fortunate that Mr.
Kendricks wrote his name for the first dance only, and
didn&rsquo;t go on and fill it up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, we didn&rsquo;t think it was worth while!&rdquo;
she innocently explained.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And that&rsquo;s what makes it so perfectly
providential, as Mrs. March says.&nbsp; Now then,&rdquo; I went
on, as I wrote in the name of a rising young politician, who
happened just then to have been announced as arriving in Saratoga
to join some other leaders in arranging the slate of his party
for the convention to meet a month later, &ldquo;we will begin
with a good American.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I handed the card to Kendricks.&nbsp; &ldquo;Do you happen to
remember the name of the young French nobleman who danced the
third dance with Miss Gage?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;but I think I could invent
it.&rdquo;&nbsp; And he dashed down an extremely probable
marquis, while Miss Gage clapped her hands for joy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, how glorious! how splendid!&rdquo;</p>
<p>I asked, &ldquo;Will you ever give me away the longest day you
live?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never,&rdquo; she promised; and I added the name of a
South American doctor, one of those doctors who seem to be always
becoming the presidents of their republics, and ordering all
their patients of opposite politics to be shot in the plaza.</p>
<p>Kendricks entered a younger son of an English duke, and I
contributed the hyphenated surname of a New York swell, and
between us we soon had all the dances on Miss Gage&rsquo;s card
taken by the most distinguished people.&nbsp; We really studied
probability in the forgery, and we were proud of the air of
reality it wore in the carefully differenced handwritings, with
national traits nicely accented in each.</p>
<h2><a name="page162"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
162</span>XVI</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> fun of it all was that Mrs.
March was not deceived for an instant.&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh,
nonsense!&rdquo; she said, when she glanced at our pretty
deception, which we presented with perhaps too perfect
seriousness.&nbsp; &ldquo;Then you danced only the first
dance?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no!&rdquo; Miss Gage protested.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
danced every dance as long as I stayed.&rdquo;&nbsp; She laughed
with her handkerchief to her mouth and her eyes shining
above.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; I can testify to that, Mrs. March,&rdquo; said
Kendricks, and he laughed wildly, too.&nbsp; I must say their
laughter throughout was far beyond the mirthfulness of the
facts.&nbsp; They both protested that they had had the best time
in the world, and the gayest time; that I had been a mirror of
chaperons, and followed them round with my eyes wherever they
went like a family portrait; and that they were the most
exemplary young couple at the hop in their behaviour.&nbsp; Mrs.
March asked them all about it, and she joined in their fun with a
hilarity which I knew from long experience boded me no good.</p>
<p>When Kendricks had gone away, and Miss Gage had left us for
the night with an embrace, whose fondness I wondered at, from
Mrs. March, an awful silence fell upon us in the deserted parlour
where she had waited up.</p>
<p>I knew that when she broke the silence she would begin with,
&ldquo;Well, my dear!&rdquo; and this was what she did.&nbsp; She
added, &ldquo;I hope you&rsquo;re convinced
<i>now</i>!&rdquo;</p>
<p>I did not even pretend not to understand.&nbsp; &ldquo;You
mean that they are in love?&nbsp; I suppose that their we-ing and
us-ing so much would indicate something of the kind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t that alone; everything indicates
it.&nbsp; She would hardly let go of him with her eyes.&nbsp; I
wish,&rdquo; sighed Mrs. March, and she let her head droop upon
her hand a moment, &ldquo;I could be as sure of him as I am of
her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t that double the difficulty?&rdquo; I
ventured to suggest, though till she spoke I had not doubted that
it was the case.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should make you speak to him if I were sure of him;
but as it is I shall speak to her, and the sooner the
better.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To-night?&rdquo; I quaked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No; I shall let the poor thing have her sleep
to-night.&nbsp; But the first thing in the morning I shall speak,
and I want you to send her up to me as soon as she&rsquo;s had
her breakfast.&nbsp; Tell her I&rsquo;m not well, and shall not
be down; I shall not close my eyes the whole night.&nbsp; And
now,&rdquo; she added, &ldquo;I want you to tell me everything
that happened this evening.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t omit a word, or a
look, or a motion.&nbsp; I wish to proceed
intelligently.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I hope I was accurate in the history of the hop which I gave
Mrs. March; I am sure I was full.&nbsp; I think my account may be
justly described as having a creative truthfulness, if no other
merit.&nbsp; I had really no wish to conceal anything except the
fact that I had not, in my utter helplessness, even tried to get
Miss Gage any other partners.&nbsp; But in the larger interest of
the present situation, Mrs. March seemed to have lost the sense
of my dereliction in this respect.&nbsp; She merely asked,
&ldquo;And it was after you went back to the parlour, just before
you came home, that you wrote those names on her card?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Kendricks wrote half of them,&rdquo; I said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I dare say.&nbsp; Well, it was very amusing, and if the
circumstances were different, I could have entered into the
spirit of it too.&nbsp; But you see yourself, Basil, that we
can&rsquo;t let this affair go any further without dealing
frankly with her.&nbsp; <i>You</i> can&rsquo;t speak to her, and
<i>I must</i>.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t you see?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I said that I saw, but I had suddenly a wild wish that it were
practicable for me to speak to Miss Gage.&nbsp; I should have
liked to have a peep into a girl&rsquo;s heart at just such a
moment, when it must be quivering with the unconfessed sense of
love, and the confident hope of being loved, but while as yet
nothing was assured, nothing was ascertained.&nbsp; If it would
not have been shocking, if it would not have been sacrilegious,
it would have been infinitely interesting, and from an
&aelig;sthetic point of view infinitely important.&nbsp; I
thought that I should have been willing to undergo all the
embarrassment of such an inquiry for the sake of its precious
results, if it had been at all possible; but I acquiesced that it
would not be possible.&nbsp; I felt that I was getting off pretty
lightly not to have it brought home to me again that I was the
cause of all this trouble, and that if it had not been for me
there would have been, as far as Mrs. March was concerned, no
Miss Gage, and no love-affair of hers to deal with.&nbsp; I
debated in my mind a moment whether I had better urge her to let
me speak to Kendricks after all; but I forbore, and in the
morning I waited about in much perturbation, after I had sent
Miss Gage to her, until I could know the result of their
interview.&nbsp; When I saw the girl come away from her room,
which she did rather trippingly, I went to her, and found her by
no means the wreck I had expected the ordeal to leave her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you meet Miss Gage?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; I returned, with tremulous expectation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, don&rsquo;t you think she looks perfectly divine
in that gown?&nbsp; It&rsquo;s one of Mme. Cody&rsquo;s, and we
got it for thirty dollars.&nbsp; It would have been fifty in New
York, and it was, here, earlier in the season.&nbsp; I shall
always come here for some of my things; as soon as the
season&rsquo;s a little past they simply <i>fling</i> them
away.&nbsp; Well, my dear!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, what?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t speak to her after all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t!&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t you think
she&rsquo;s in love with him, then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I couldn&rsquo;t somehow seem to approach the
subject as I had expected to.&nbsp; She was so happy, and so
good, and so perfectly obedient, that I couldn&rsquo;t get
anything to take hold of.&nbsp; You see, I didn&rsquo;t know but
she might be a little rebellious, or resentful of my
interference; but in the little gingerly attempts I did make she
was so submissive, don&rsquo;t you understand?&nbsp; And she was
very modest about Mr. Kendricks&rsquo; attentions, and so
self-depreciatory that, well&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look here, Isabel,&rdquo; I broke in, &ldquo;this is
pretty shameless of you.&nbsp; You pretend to be in the greatest
kind of fidge about this girl; and you make me lie awake all
night thinking what you&rsquo;re going to say to her; and now you
as much as tell me you were so fascinated with the modest way she
was in love that you couldn&rsquo;t say anything to her against
being in love on our hands in any sort of way.&nbsp; Do you call
this business?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t care if I <i>did</i> encourage
her&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, you even encouraged her!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I <i>didn&rsquo;t</i> encourage her.&nbsp; I merely
praised Mr. Kendricks, and said how much you thought of him as a
writer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! then you gave the subject a literary cast.&nbsp; I
see!&nbsp; Do you think Miss Gage was able to follow
you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That doesn&rsquo;t matter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what do you propose to do now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I propose to do nothing.&nbsp; I think that I have done
all my duty requires, and that now I can leave the whole affair
to you.&nbsp; It was your affair in the beginning.&nbsp; I
don&rsquo;t see why I should worry myself about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It seems to me that this is a very strange position for
a lady to take who was not going to close an eye last night in
view of a situation which has not changed in the least, except
for the worse.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t you think you are rather
culpably light-hearted all of a sudden?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am light-hearted, but if there is any culpability it
is yours, Basil.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I reflected, but I failed to find any novelty in the
fact.&nbsp; &ldquo;Very well, then; what do you propose that I
should do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I leave that entirely to your own
conscience.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And if my conscience has no suggestion to
make?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s your affair.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I reflected again, and then I said, more than anything to make
her uncomfortable, I&rsquo;m afraid: &ldquo;I feel perfectly easy
in my conscience, personally, but I have a social duty in the
matter, and I hope I shall perform it with more fidelity and
courage than you have shown.&nbsp; I shall speak to
Kendricks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She said: &ldquo;That is just what you ought to do.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;m quite surprised.&rdquo;&nbsp; After this touch of irony
she added earnestly, &ldquo;And I do hope, my dear, you will use
judgment in speaking to him, and tact.&nbsp; You mustn&rsquo;t go
at it bluntly.&nbsp; Remember that Mr. Kendricks is not at all to
blame.&nbsp; He began to show her attention to oblige us, and if
she has fallen in love with him it is our fault.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall handle him without gloves,&rdquo; I said.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I shall tell him he had better go away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I was joking, but she said seriously, &ldquo;Yes; he must go
away.&nbsp; And I don&rsquo;t envy you having to tell him.&nbsp;
I suppose you will bungle it, of course.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, then, you must advise me,&rdquo; I said; and we
really began to consider the question.&nbsp; We could hardly
exaggerate the difficulty and delicacy of the duty before
me.&nbsp; We recognised that before I made any explicit demand of
him I must first ascertain the nature of the whole ground and
then be governed by the facts.&nbsp; It would be simple enough if
I had merely to say that we thought the girl&rsquo;s affections
were becoming engaged, and then appeal to his eager generosity,
his delicate magnanimity; but there were possible complications
on his side which must be regarded.&nbsp; I was to ascertain, we
concluded, the exact nature of the situation before I ventured to
say anything openly.&nbsp; I was to make my approaches by a
series of ambushes before I unmasked my purpose, and perhaps I
must not unmask it at all.&nbsp; As I set off on my mission,
which must begin with finding Kendricks at his hotel, Mrs. March
said she pitied me.&nbsp; She called me back to ask whether I
thought I had really better do anything.&nbsp; Then, as I showed
signs of weakening, she drove me from her with, &ldquo;Yes,
yes!&nbsp; You must!&nbsp; You must!&rdquo;</p>
<h2><a name="page171"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
171</span>XVII</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was still so early that I had my
doubts whether I should find Kendricks up after the last
night&rsquo;s revelry, but he met me half-way between our hotel
and his.&nbsp; He said he was coming to see how Mrs. March was
bearing Miss Gage&rsquo;s immense success at the ball; but
perhaps this was not his sole motive.&nbsp; He asked frankly how
the young lady was, and whether I thought Mrs. March would
consider a lunch at a restaurant by the lake a good notion.&nbsp;
When I said I had very little doubt she would, and proposed
taking a turn in the park before I went back with him, he looked
at his watch and laughed, and said he supposed it <i>was</i>
rather early yet, and came very willingly with me.</p>
<p>We had the pretty place almost to ourselves at that
hour.&nbsp; There were a half-dozen or so nursemaids, pushing
their perambulators about, or standing the vehicles across the
walk in front of the benches where they sat, in the simple belief
of all people who have to do with babies that the rest of the
world may be fitly discommoded in their behalf.&nbsp; But they
did not actively molest us, and they scarcely circumscribed our
choice of seats.&nbsp; We were by no means driven to the little
kiosk in the lake for them, and I should rather say that we were
fatefully led there, so apt were the associations of the place to
my purpose.&nbsp; Nothing could have been more natural than that
I should say, as we sat down there, &ldquo;This was where I first
saw Miss Gage with her friends&rdquo;; and it was by a perfectly
natural transition that I should go on to speak, in a
semi-humorous strain, of the responsibility which Mrs. March and
myself had incurred by letting our sympathy for her run away with
us.&nbsp; I said I supposed that if we had not been willing from
the first to try to realise for her some of the expectations we
imagined she had in coming to Saratoga, she never would have
fallen to our charge; that people really brought a great many
more things upon themselves than they were willing to own; and
that fate was perhaps more the fulfilment of our tacit ambitions
than our overt acts.&nbsp; This bit of philosophy, which I
confess I thought fine, did not seem to impress Kendricks.&nbsp;
He merely said that it must be great fun to have the chance of
baffling the malice of circumstance in a case like that, and I
perceived that he felt nothing complex in the situation.&nbsp; In
fact, I doubt whether youth perceives anything complex in
life.&nbsp; To the young, life is a very plain case.&nbsp; To be
sure, they are much more alarmed than their elders at getting
tangled up in its web at times, but that is because they have not
had our experience in getting untangled, and think they are never
going to get out alive.&nbsp; When they do, they think that it is
the only tangle they are ever going to be in, and do not know
that they are simply going on from one to another as long as
there is enough of them left to be caught in a mesh.&nbsp; To
Kendricks we Marches were simply two amiable people, who had
fancied doing a pleasant thing for a beautiful girl that accident
had thrown it in our power to befriend, and were by no means the
trembling arbiters of her destiny we felt ourselves to be.&nbsp;
The difference between his objective sense and my subjective
sense was the difference between his twenty-seven years and my
fifty-two, and while this remained I saw that it would be useless
to try to get on common ground with him, or to give him our point
of view.&nbsp; If I were to speak to him at all, it must be with
authority, with the right of one who stood in the place of the
girl&rsquo;s parents, and had her happiness at heart.&nbsp; That
is, it was something like that; but my words say it too
bluntly.&nbsp; I found myself beginning, &ldquo;I have rather had
a notion that her father might come on, and take the enterprise
off our hands,&rdquo; though, to tell the truth, I had never
imagined such a thing, which came into my head at that moment
through an association with the thought of parents.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you any idea what sort of man he is?&rdquo; asked
Kendricks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, some little local magnate, president of the village
and president of the village bank; I fancy the chief figure in
the place, but probably as ignorant of our world as a
Cherokee.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; said the young
fellow.&nbsp; &ldquo;Do you think that follows because he
doesn&rsquo;t live in it?&rdquo;&nbsp; I could see that he did
not quite like what I had said.&nbsp; &ldquo;I suppose ours is
rather a small world.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The smallest of all worlds,&rdquo; I answered.&nbsp;
&ldquo;And in the eyes of Papa Gage, if they could once be
focused upon it, our world would shrivel to an atom.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you think,&rdquo; he asked, with a manifest anxiety,
&ldquo;that it would in hers?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No; she is not the American people, and her father is,
as I fancy him.&nbsp; I make out from the vague hints that
Brother Deering (as Fulkerson would call him) dropped when he
talked about him that Papa Gage is a shrewd, practical,
home-keeping business man, with an eye single to the main chance,
lavish, but not generous, Philistine to the backbone, blindly
devoted to his daughter, and contemptuous of all the myriad
mysteries of civilisation that he doesn&rsquo;t understand.&nbsp;
I don&rsquo;t know why I should be authorised to imagine him
personally long and lank, with possibly a tobacco habit of some
sort.&nbsp; His natural history, upon no better authority, is
that of a hard-headed farmer, who found out that farming could
never be more than a livelihood, and came into the village, and
began to lend money, and get gain, till he was in a position to
help found the De Witt Point National Bank, and then, by weight
of his moneyed solidity, imposed himself upon the free and
independent voters of the village&mdash;a majority of them under
mortgage to him&mdash;and became its president.&nbsp; It
isn&rsquo;t a pleasant type, but it&rsquo;s ideally
American.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Kendricks ruefully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But his daughter,&rdquo; I continued, &ldquo;is
probably altogether different.&nbsp; There is something fine
about her&mdash;really fine.&nbsp; Our world wouldn&rsquo;t
shrivel in her eye; it would probably swell up and fill the
universe,&rdquo; I added by an impulse that came from nowhere
irresistibly upon me: &ldquo;that is, if she could see <i>you</i>
in it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; he asked with a start.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, now I must tell you what I mean,&rdquo; I said
desperately.&nbsp; &ldquo;It&rsquo;s you that have complicated
this case so dreadfully for us.&nbsp; Can&rsquo;t you think
why?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I can&rsquo;t,&rdquo; he said; but he had to say
that.</p>
<p>His fine, sensitive face flamed at once so fire-red that it
could only turn pale for a change when I plunged on:
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid we&rsquo;ve trifled with her
happiness&rdquo;; and this formulation of the case disgusted me
so much that I laughed wildly, and added, &ldquo;unless
we&rsquo;ve trifled with yours, too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know why you call it trifling with
happiness,&rdquo; he returned with dignity, but without
offence.&nbsp; &ldquo;If you will leave her out of the question,
I will say that you have given me the greatest happiness of my
life in introducing me to Miss Gage.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; I demanded, &ldquo;may I ask what
<i>you</i> mean?&nbsp; You know I wouldn&rsquo;t if I
didn&rsquo;t feel bound for her sake, and if you hadn&rsquo;t
said just what you have said.&nbsp; You needn&rsquo;t answer me
unless you like!&nbsp; It&rsquo;s pleasant to know that
you&rsquo;ve not been bored, and Mrs. March and I are infinitely
obliged to you for helping us out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kendricks made as if he were going to say something, and then
he did not.&nbsp; He hung his head lower and lower in the silence
which I had to break for him&mdash;&ldquo;I hope I haven&rsquo;t
been intrusive, my dear fellow.&nbsp; This is something I felt
bound to speak of.&nbsp; You know we couldn&rsquo;t let it go
on.&nbsp; Mrs. March and I have blamed ourselves a good deal, and
we couldn&rsquo;t let it go on.&nbsp; But I&rsquo;m afraid I
haven&rsquo;t been as delicate with you&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! delicate!&rdquo;&nbsp; He lifted his head and
flashed a face of generous self-reproach upon me.&nbsp;
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s <i>I</i> that haven&rsquo;t been delicate with
<i>you</i>.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve been monstrously indelicate.&nbsp;
But I never meant to be, and&mdash;and&mdash;I was coming to see
you just now when we met&mdash;to see you&mdash;Miss
Gage&mdash;and ask her&mdash;tell her that we&mdash;I&mdash;must
tell you and Mrs. March&mdash;Mr. March!&nbsp; At the hop last
night I asked her to be my wife, and as soon as she can hear from
her father&mdash;But the first thing when I woke this morning, I
saw that I must tell Mrs. March and you.&nbsp; And you&mdash;you
must forgive us&mdash;or me, rather; for it was my
fault&mdash;for not telling you last night&mdash;at
once&mdash;oh, thank you! thank you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>I had seized his hand, and was wringing it vehemently in
expression of my pleasure in what he had told me.&nbsp; In that
first moment I felt nothing but pure joy and an immeasurable
relief.&nbsp; I drew my breath, a very deep and full one, in a
sudden, absolute freedom from anxieties which had been none the
less real and constant because so often burlesqued.&nbsp;
Afterward considerations presented themselves to alloy my
rapture, but for that moment, as I say, it was nothing but
rapture.&nbsp; There was no question in it of the lovers&rsquo;
fitness for each other, of their acceptability to their
respective families, of their general conduct, or of their
especial behaviour toward us.&nbsp; All that I could realise was
that it was a great escape for both of us, and a great triumph
for me.&nbsp; I had been afraid that I should not have the
courage to speak to Kendricks of the matter at all, much less ask
him to go away; and here I had actually spoken to him, with the
splendid result that I need only congratulate him on his
engagement to the lady whose unrequited affections I had been
wishing him to spare.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t remember just the terms
I used in doing this, but they seemed satisfactory to Kendricks;
probably a repetition of the letters of the alphabet would have
been equally acceptable.&nbsp; At last I said, &ldquo;Well, now I
must go and tell the great news to Mrs. March,&rdquo; and I shook
hands with him again; we had been shaking hands at half-minutely
intervals ever since the first time.</p>
<h2><a name="page180"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
180</span>XVIII</h2>
<p>I <span class="smcap">saw</span> Mrs. March waiting for me on
the hotel verandah.&nbsp; She wore her bonnet, and she warned me
not to approach, and then ran down to meet me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, my dear,&rdquo; she said, as she pushed her hand
through my arm and began to propel me away from the sight and
hearing of people on the piazza, &ldquo;I hope you didn&rsquo;t
make a fool of yourself with Kendricks.&nbsp; They&rsquo;re
engaged!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She apparently expected me to be prostrated by this
stroke.&nbsp; &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; I said very coolly; &ldquo;I was
just coming to tell you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How did you know it?&nbsp; Who told you?&nbsp; Did
Kendricks?&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t believe it!&rdquo; she cried in an
excitement not unmixed with resentment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No one told me,&rdquo; I said.&nbsp; &ldquo;I simply
divined it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She didn&rsquo;t mind that for a moment.&nbsp; &ldquo;Well,
I&rsquo;m glad he had the grace to do so, and I hope he did it
before you asked him any leading questions.&rdquo;&nbsp; Without
waiting to hear whether this was so or not, she went on, with an
emphasis on the next word that almost blotted it out of the
language, &ldquo;<i>She</i> came back to me almost the instant
you were gone, and told me everything.&nbsp; She said she wanted
to tell me last night, but she hadn&rsquo;t the courage, and this
morning, when she saw that I was beginning to hint up to Mr.
Kendricks a little, she hadn&rsquo;t the courage at all.&nbsp; I
sent her straight off to telegraph for her father.&nbsp; She is
behaving splendidly.&nbsp; And now, what are we going to
do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What the rest of the world is&mdash;nothing.&nbsp; It
seems to me that we are out of the story, my dear.&nbsp; At any
rate, I shan&rsquo;t attempt to compete with Miss Gage in
splendid behaviour, and I hope you won&rsquo;t.&nbsp; It would be
so easy for us.&nbsp; I wonder what Papa Gage is going to be
like.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I felt my thrill of apprehension impart itself to her.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Yes!&rdquo; she gasped; &ldquo;what if he shouldn&rsquo;t
like it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, then, that&rsquo;s his affair.&rdquo;&nbsp; But I
did not feel so lightly about it as I spoke, and from time to
time during the day I was overtaken with a cold dismay at the
thought of the unknown quantity in the problem.</p>
<p>When we returned to the hotel after a tour of the block, we
saw Kendricks in our corner of the verandah with Miss Gage.&nbsp;
They were both laughing convulsively, and they ran down to meet
us in yet wilder throes of merriment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve just been comparing notes,&rdquo; he said,
&ldquo;and at the very moment when I was telling you, Mr. March,
Julia was telling Mrs. March.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wonderful case of telepathy,&rdquo; I mocked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Give it to the Psychical Research.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They both seemed a little daunted, and Miss Gage said,
&ldquo;I know Mr. March doesn&rsquo;t like the way we&rsquo;ve
done.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Like it!&rdquo; cried Mrs. March, contriving to shake
me a little with the hand she still had in my arm.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Of course he likes it.&nbsp; He was just saying you had
behaved splendidly.&nbsp; He said <i>he</i> wouldn&rsquo;t
attempt to compete with you.&nbsp; But you mustn&rsquo;t regard
him in the least.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I admired the skill with which Isabel saved her conscience in
this statement too much to dispute it; and I suppose that
whatever she had said, Miss Gage would have been reassured.&nbsp;
I cannot particularly praise the wisdom of her behaviour during
that day, or, for the matter of that, the behaviour of Kendricks
either.&nbsp; The ideal thing would have been for him to keep
away now till her father came, but it seemed to me that he was
about under our feet all the while, and that she, so far from
making him remain at his own hotel, encouraged him to pass the
time at ours.&nbsp; Without consulting me, Mrs. March asked him
to stay to dinner after he had stayed all the forenoon, and he
made this a pretext for spending the afternoon in our corner of
the verandah.&nbsp; She made me give it up to him and Miss Gage,
so that they could be alone together, though I must say they did
not seem to mind us a great deal when we were present; he was
always leaning on the back of her chair, or sitting next her with
his hand dangling over it in a manner that made me sick.&nbsp; I
wondered if I was ever such an ass as that, and I quite lost the
respect for Kendricks&rsquo;s good sense and good taste which had
been the ground of my liking for him.</p>
<p>I felt myself withdrawn from the affair farther and farther in
sympathy, since it had now passed beyond my control; and I
resented the strain of the responsibility which I had thrown off,
I found, only for a moment, and must continue to suffer until the
girl&rsquo;s father appeared and finally relieved me.&nbsp; The
worst was that I had to bear it alone.&nbsp; It was impossible to
detach Mrs. March&rsquo;s interest from Miss Gage, as a girl who
had been made love to, long enough to enable her to realise her
as a daughter with filial ties and duties.&nbsp; She did try in a
perfunctory way to do it, but I could see that she never gave her
mind to it.&nbsp; I could not even make her share my sense of my
own culpability, a thing she was only too willing to do in most
matters.&nbsp; She admitted that it was absurd for me to have let
my fancy play about the girl when I first saw her until we felt
that I must do something for her; but I could not get her to own
that we had both acted preposterously in letting Mrs. Deering
leave Miss Gage in our charge.&nbsp; In the first place, she
denied that she had been left in our charge.&nbsp; She had simply
been left in the hotel where we were staying, and we should have
been perfectly free to do nothing for her.&nbsp; But when
Kendricks turned up so unexpectedly, it was quite natural we
should ask him to be polite to her.&nbsp; Mrs. March saw nothing
strange in all that.&nbsp; What was I worrying about?&nbsp; What
she had been afraid of was that he had not been in love with the
girl when she was so clearly in love with him.&nbsp; But now!</p>
<p>&ldquo;And suppose her father doesn&rsquo;t like
it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not like Mr. Kendricks!&rdquo;&nbsp; She stared at me,
and I could see how infatuated she was.</p>
<p>I was myself always charmed with the young fellow.&nbsp; He
was not only good and generous and handsome, and clever&mdash;I
never thought him a first-class talent&mdash;but he was
beautifully well bred, and he was very well born, as those things
go with us.&nbsp; That is, he came of people who had not done
much of anything for a generation, and had acquired merit with
themselves for it.&nbsp; They were not very rich, but they had a
right to think that he might have done nothing, or done something
better than literature; and I wish I could set forth exactly the
terms, tacit and explicit, in which his mother and sisters
condoned his dereliction to me at a reception where he presented
me to them.&nbsp; In virtue of his wish to do something, he had
become a human being, and they could not quite follow him; but
they were very polite in tolerating me, and trying to make me
feel that I was not at all odd, though he was so queer in being
proud of writing for my paper, as they called it.&nbsp; He was so
unlike them all that I liked him more than ever after meeting
them.&nbsp; Still, I could imagine a fond father, as I imagined
Miss Gage&rsquo;s father to be, objecting to him, on some grounds
at least, till he knew him, and Mrs. March apparently could not
imagine even this.</p>
<p>I do not know why I should have prefigured Miss Gage&rsquo;s
father as tall and lank.&nbsp; She was not herself so very tall,
though she was rather tall than short, and though she was rather
of the Diana or girlish type of goddess, she was by no means
lank.&nbsp; Yet it was in this shape that I had always thought of
him, perhaps through an obscure association with his
fellow-villager, Deering.&nbsp; I had fancied him saturnine of
spirit, slovenly of dress, and lounging of habit, upon no
authority that I could allege, and I was wholly unprepared for
the neat, small figure of a man, very precise of manner and
scrupulous of aspect, who said, &ldquo;How do you do, sir?&nbsp;
I hope I see you well, sir,&rdquo; when his daughter presented us
to each other, the morning after the eventful day described, and
he shook my hand with his very small, dry hand.</p>
<p>I could not make out from their manner with each other whether
they had been speaking of the great matter in hand or not.&nbsp;
I am rather at a loss about people of that Philistine make as to
what their procedure will be in circumstances where I know just
what people of my own sort of sophistication would do.&nbsp;
These would come straight at the trouble, but I fancy that with
the other sort the convention is a preliminary reserve.&nbsp; I
found Mr. Gage disposed to prolong, with me at least, a
discussion of the weather, and the aspects of Saratoga, the
events of his journey from De Witt Point, and the hardship of
having to ride all the way to Mooer&rsquo;s Junction in a
stage-coach.&nbsp; I felt more and more, while we bandied these
futilities, as if Mr. Gage had an overdue note of mine, and was
waiting for me, since I could not pay it, to make some
proposition toward its renewal; and he did really tire me out at
last, so that I said, &ldquo;Well, Mr. Gage, I suppose Miss Gage
has told you something of the tremendous situation that has
developed itself here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I thought I had better give the affair such smiling character
as a jocose treatment might impart, and the dry little man
twinkled up responsively so far as manner was concerned.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Well, yes, yes.&nbsp; There has been some talk of it
between us,&rdquo; and again he left the word to me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mrs. March urged your daughter to send for you at once
because that was the right and fit thing to do, and because we
felt that the affair had now quite transcended our powers, such
as they were, and nobody could really cope with it but
yourself.&nbsp; I hope you were not unduly alarmed by the
summons?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not at all.&nbsp; She said in the despatch that she was
not sick.&nbsp; I had been anticipating a short visit to Saratoga
for some days, and my business was in a shape so that I could
leave.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; I said vaguely, &ldquo;I am very glad.&nbsp;
Mrs. March felt, as I did, that circumstances had given us a
certain obligation in regard to Miss Gage, and we were anxious to
discharge it faithfully and to the utmost.&nbsp; We should have
written to you, summoned you, before, if we could have
supposed&mdash;or been sure; but you know these things go on so
obscurely, and we acted at the very first possible moment.&nbsp;
I wish you to understand that.&nbsp; We talked it over a great
deal, and I hope you will believe that we studied
throughout&mdash;that we were most solicitous from beginning to
end for Miss Gage&rsquo;s happiness, and that if we could have
foreseen or imagined&mdash;if we could have taken any
steps&mdash;I trust you will believe&mdash;&rdquo;&nbsp; I was
furious at myself for being so confoundedly apologetic, for I was
thinking all the time of the bother and affliction we had had
with the girl; and there sat that little wooden image accepting
my self-inculpations, and apparently demanding more of me; but I
could not help going on in the same strain: &ldquo;We felt
especially bound in the matter, from the fact that Mr. Kendricks
was a personal friend of ours, whom we are very fond of, and we
both are very anxious that you should not suppose that we
promoted, or that we were not most vigilant&mdash;that we were
for a moment forgetful of your rights in such an
affair&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>I stopped, and Mr. Gage passed his hand across his little
meagre, smiling mouth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then he is not a connection of yours, Mr.
March?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bless me, no!&rdquo; I said in great relief; &ldquo;we
are not so swell as that.&rdquo;&nbsp; And I tried to give him
some notion of Kendricks&rsquo;s local quality, repeating a list
of agglutinated New York surnames to which his was more or less
affiliated.&nbsp; They always amuse me, those names, which more
than any in the world give the notion of social straining; but I
doubt if they affected the imagination of Mr. Gage, either in
this way or in the way I meanly meant them to affect him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what did you say his business was?&rdquo; he asked,
with that implication of a previous statement on your part which
some people think it so clever to make when they question
you.</p>
<p>I always hate it, and I avenged myself by answering simply,
&ldquo;Bless my soul, he has no business!&rdquo; and letting him
take up the word now or not, as he liked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then he is a man of independent means?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I could not resist answering, &ldquo;Independent means?&nbsp;
Kendricks has no means whatever.&rdquo;&nbsp; But having dealt
this blow, I could add, &ldquo;I believe his mother has some
money.&nbsp; They are people who live comfortably.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then he has no profession?&rdquo; asked Mr. Gage, with
a little more stringency in his smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know whether you will call it a
profession.&nbsp; He is a writer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; Mr. Gage softly breathed.&nbsp; &ldquo;Does
he write for your&mdash;paper?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I noted that as to the literary technicalities he seemed not
to be much more ignorant than Kendricks&rsquo;s own family, and I
said, tolerantly, &ldquo;Yes; he writes for our
magazine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Magazine&mdash;yes; I beg your pardon,&rdquo; he
interrupted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And for any others where he can place his
material.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This apparently did not convey any very luminous idea to Mr.
Gage&rsquo;s mind, and he asked after a moment, &ldquo;What kind
of things does he write?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, stories, sketches, poems, reviews,
essays&mdash;almost anything, in fact.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The light left his face, and I perceived that I had carried my
revenge too far, at least for Kendricks&rsquo;s advantage, and I
determined to take a new departure at the first chance.&nbsp; The
chance did not come immediately.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And can a man support a wife by that kind of
writing?&rdquo; asked Mr. Gage.</p>
<p>I laughed uneasily.&nbsp; &ldquo;Some people do.&nbsp; It
depends upon how much of it he can sell.&nbsp; It depends upon
how handsomely a wife wishes to be supported.&nbsp; The result
isn&rsquo;t usually beyond the dreams of avarice,&rdquo; I said,
with a desperate levity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Excuse me,&rdquo; returned the little man.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Do you live in that way?&nbsp; By your
writings?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; I said with some state, which I tried to
subdue; &ldquo;I am the editor of <i>Every Other Week</i>, and
part owner.&nbsp; Mr. Kendricks is merely a
contributor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; he breathed again.&nbsp; &ldquo;And if he
were successful in selling his writings, how much would he
probably make in a year?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In a year?&rdquo; I repeated, to gain time.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Mr. Kendricks is comparatively a beginner.&nbsp; Say
fifteen hundred&mdash;two thousand&mdash;twenty-five
hundred.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And that would not go very far in New York.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No; that would not go far in New York.&rdquo;&nbsp; I
was beginning to find a certain pleasure in dealing so frankly
with this hard little man.&nbsp; I liked to see him suffer, and I
could see that he did suffer; he suffered as a father must who
learns that from a pecuniary point of view his daughter is
imprudently in love.&nbsp; Why should we always regard such a
sufferer as a comic figure?&nbsp; He is, if we think of it
rightly, a most serious, even tragical figure, and at all events
a most respectable figure.&nbsp; He loves her, and his heart is
torn between the wish to indulge her and the wish to do what will
be finally best for her.&nbsp; Why should our sympathies, in such
a case, be all for the foolish young lovers?&nbsp; They ought in
great measure to be for the father, too.&nbsp; Something like a
sense of this smote me, and I was ashamed in my pleasure.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I should say, Mr. March, that this seems a most
undesirable engagement for my daughter.&nbsp; What should you
say?&nbsp; I ask you to make the case your own.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Excuse me,&rdquo; I answered; &ldquo;I would much
rather not make the case my own, Mr. Gage, and I must decline to
have you consult me.&nbsp; I think that in this matter I have
done all that I was called upon to do.&nbsp; I have told you what
I know of Mr. Kendricks&rsquo;s circumstances and
connections.&nbsp; As to his character, I can truly say that he
is one of the best men I ever knew.&nbsp; I believe in his
absolute purity of heart, and he is the most unselfish, the most
generous&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Gage waved the facts aside with his hand.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
don&rsquo;t undervalue those things.&nbsp; If I could be master,
no one should have my girl without them.&nbsp; But they do not
constitute a livelihood.&nbsp; From what you tell me of Mr.
Kendricks&rsquo;s prospects, I am not prepared to say that I
think the outlook is brilliant.&nbsp; If he has counted upon my
supplying a deficiency&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, excuse me, Mr. Gage!&nbsp; Your
insinuation&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Excuse <i>me</i>!&rdquo; he retorted.&nbsp; &ldquo;I am
making no insinuation.&nbsp; I merely wish to say that, while my
means are such as to enable me to live in comfort at De Witt
Point, I am well aware that much more would be needed in New York
to enable my daughter to live in the same comfort.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;m not willing she should live in less.&nbsp; I think it
is my duty to say that I am not at all a rich man, and if there
has been any supposition that I am so, it is a mistake that
cannot be corrected too soon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This time I could not resent his insinuation, for since he had
begun to speak I had become guiltily aware of having felt a sort
of ease in regard to Kendricks&rsquo;s modesty of competence from
a belief, given me, I suspect, by the talk of Deering, that Mr.
Gage had plenty of money, and could come to the rescue in any
amount needed.&nbsp; I could only say, &ldquo;Mr. Gage, all this
is so far beyond my control that I ought not to allow you to say
it to me.&nbsp; It is something that you must say to Mr.
Kendricks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As I spoke I saw the young fellow come round the corner of the
street, and mount the hotel steps.&nbsp; He did not see me, for
he did not look toward the little corner of lawn where Mr. Gage
and I had put our chairs for the sake of the morning shade, and
for the seclusion that the spot afforded us.&nbsp; It was at the
angle of the house farthest from our peculiar corner of the
piazza, whither I had the belief that the girl had withdrawn when
she left me to her father.&nbsp; I was sure that Kendricks would
seek her there, far enough beyond eyeshot or earshot of us, and I
had no doubt that she was expecting him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are Mr. Kendricks&rsquo;s friend&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have tried much more to be Miss Gage&rsquo;s friend;
and Mrs. March&mdash;&rdquo;&nbsp; It came into my mind that she
was most selfishly and shamelessly keeping out of the way, and I
could not go on and celebrate her magnanimous impartiality, her
eager and sleepless vigilance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have no doubt of that,&rdquo; said the little man,
&ldquo;and I am very much obliged to you for all the trouble you
have taken on my daughter&rsquo;s account.&nbsp; But you are his
friend, and I can speak to you much more fully and frankly than I
could to him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I did not know just what to say to this, and he went on:
&ldquo;In point of fact, I don&rsquo;t think that I shall speak
to him at all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is quite your affair, my dear sir,&rdquo; I said
dryly.&nbsp; &ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t to be supposed that you would
seek an interview with him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And if he seeks an interview with me, I shall decline
it.&rdquo;&nbsp; He looked at me defiantly and yet
interrogatively.&nbsp; I could see that he was very angry, and
yet uncertain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I must say, then, Mr. Gage, that I don&rsquo;t think
you would be right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How, not right?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should say that in equity he had a full and perfect
right to meet you, and to talk this matter over with you.&nbsp;
He has done you no wrong whatever in admiring your daughter, and
wishing to marry her.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s for you and her to decide
whether you will let him.&nbsp; But as far as his wish goes, and
his expression of it to her, he is quite within his rights.&nbsp;
You must see that yourself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I consider,&rdquo; he answered, &ldquo;that he has done
me a wrong in that very thing.&nbsp; A man without means, or any
stated occupation, he had no business to speak to my daughter
without speaking to me.&nbsp; He took advantage of the
circumstances.&nbsp; What does he think?&nbsp; Does he suppose I
am <i>made</i> of money?&nbsp; Does he suppose I want to support
a son-in-law?&nbsp; I can tell you that if I were possessed of
unlimited means, I should not do it.&rdquo;&nbsp; I began to
suspect that Deering was nearer right, after all, in his
representations of the man&rsquo;s financial ability; I fancied
something of the anxiety, the tremor of avarice, in his
resentment of poor Kendricks&rsquo;s possible, or rather
impossible, designs upon his pocket.&nbsp; &ldquo;If he had any
profession, or any kind of business, I should feel differently,
and I should be willing to assist him to a reasonable degree; or
if he had a business training, I might take him in with me; but
as it is, I should have a helpless burden on my hands, and I can
tell you I am not going in for that sort of thing.&nbsp; I shall
make short work of it.&nbsp; I shall decline to meet Mr.
Hendricks, or Kendricks, and I shall ask you to say as much to
him from me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I shall decline to be the bearer of any such
message from you, Mr. Gage,&rdquo; I answered, and I saw, not
without pleasure, the bewilderment that began to mix with his
arrogance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well, then, sir,&rdquo; he answered, after a
moment; &ldquo;I shall simply take my daughter away with me, and
that will end it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The prim little, grim little man looked at me with his hard
eyes, and set his lips so close that the beard on the lower one
stuck out at me with a sort of additional menace I felt that he
was too capable of doing what he said, and I lost myself in a
sense of his sordidness, a sense which was almost without a trace
of compassion.</p>
<p>It seemed as if I were a long time under the spell of this,
and the sight of his repugnant face; but it could really have
been merely a moment, when I heard a stir of drapery on the grass
near us, and the soft, rich voice of Miss Gage saying,
&ldquo;Papa!&rdquo;</p>
<p>We both started to our feet.&nbsp; I do not know whether she
had heard what he said or not.&nbsp; We had spoken low, and in
the utmost vehemence of his speech he did not lift his
voice.&nbsp; In any case, she did not heed what he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Papa,&rdquo; she repeated, &ldquo;I want you to come up
and see Mrs. March on the piazza.&nbsp; And&mdash;Mr. Kendricks
is there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I had a wild desire to laugh at what followed, and yet it was
not without its pathos.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&mdash;I&mdash;hm!
hm!&nbsp; I&mdash;cannot see Mr. Kendricks just at present.&nbsp;
I&mdash;the fact is, I do not want to see him.&nbsp; It is
better&mdash;not.&nbsp; I think you had better get ready to go
home with me at once, daughter.&nbsp; I&mdash;hm!&mdash;cannot
approve of any engagement to Mr. Kendricks, and I&mdash;prefer
not to meet him.&rdquo;&nbsp; He stopped.</p>
<p>Miss Gage said nothing, and I cannot say that she looked
anything.&nbsp; She simply <i>clouded up</i>, if I may so express
the effect that came and remained upon her countenance, which was
now the countenance she had shown me the first evening I saw her,
when I saw the Deerings cowering in its shadow.&nbsp; I had no
need to look at the adamantine little man before her to know that
he was softening into wax, and, in fact, I felt a sort of
indecency in beholding his inteneration, for I knew that it came
from his heart, and had its consecration through his love for
her.</p>
<p>That is why I turned away, and do not know to this moment just
how the change she desired in him was brought about.&nbsp; I will
not say that I did not look back from a discreet distance, and
continue looking until I saw them start away together and move in
the direction of that corner of the piazza where Kendricks was
waiting with Mrs. March.</p>
<p>It appeared, from her account, that Mr. Gage, with no uncommon
show of ill-will, but with merely a natural dryness, suffered
Kendricks to be presented to him, and entered upon some
preliminary banalities with him, such as he had used in opening a
conversation with me.&nbsp; Before these came to a close Mrs.
March had thought it well to leave the three together.</p>
<p>Afterward, when we knew the only result that the affair could
have, she said, &ldquo;The girl has a powerful will.&nbsp; I
wonder what the mother was like.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; evidently she didn&rsquo;t get that will from her
father.&nbsp; I have still a sense of exhaustion from it in our
own case.&nbsp; What do you think it portends for poor
Kendricks!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Poor Kendricks!&rdquo; she repeated thoughtfully.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Yes; in that sense I suppose you might call him
poor.&nbsp; It isn&rsquo;t an equal thing as far as nature, as
character, goes.&nbsp; But isn&rsquo;t it always dreadful to see
two people who have made up their minds to get
married?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s very common,&rdquo; I suggested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That doesn&rsquo;t change the fact, or lessen the
risk.&nbsp; She is very beautiful, and now he is in love with her
beautiful girlhood.&nbsp; But after a while the girlhood will
go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the girl will remain,&rdquo; I said.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
